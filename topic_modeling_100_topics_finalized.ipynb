    "NMF is a model used for topic extraction - while the LDA model uses raw counts of unique words per document, NMF model uses a normalized representation of those raw counts (TF-IDF representation)\n",
    "\n",
    "TF stands for term-frequency and TF-IDF is term-frequency times inverse document-frequency. In other words, we are not only looking for how often a word appears in a given document, but also whether this particular word is distinct across all the collections of documents (corpus). For example, intuitively we understand that words like \"often\" or \"use\" are more frequently encountered, but they are less informative (more semantically-vacuous) if we want to discern a particular topic of a document, as they might be frequently encounter across all text documents in a corpus. On the other hand, words which we will see less frequently across a collection of document might indicate that those words are specific to a particular document, and, therefore, constitute a basis for a topic. \n",

      "genes mutations identify candidate gene identified zebrafish genetic drosophila defects\n",
      "--------------------\n",
      "ï»¿   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our goal is to identify genes important to schizophrenia. In the first cycle of our project, we demonstrated that damaging de novo mutations in persons with schizophrenia, from otherwise healthy families, disrupt genes that are co-expressed in the dorsolateral and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex during fetal development. Compared to their unaffected siblings, schizophrenia patients were significantly more likely to harbor such alleles. Proteins encoded by these genes functioned in neuronal migration, synaptic transmission, signaling, and transcriptional regulation. Integration of genetic data and expression data suggested possible schizophrenia-related processes and even potential targets for treatment. In the next cycle of our project, we ask whether these and other candidate genes are enriched for severe mutations in schizophrenia, by comparing mutation profiles of each gene for all cases and controls in the NIMH repository. In Aim 1, we will select ~500 candidate genes from among those with de novo damaging mutations in schizophrenia or autism, using network analytic tools to suggest those genes most likely to be causal and to identify other candidate genes. In a preliminary study, we show that an expanded network seeded by the 54 genes with damaging de novo mutations in our cases is significantly enriched for genes involved in chromatin modification and synaptic function, and for genes with de novo mutations in schizophrenia or autism from other studies. In Aim 2, we will sequence 500 candidate genes in DNA from all European American and African American schizophrenia cases and controls from the NIMH repository, ~12,000 subjects total. For each gene, we will sequence coding regions, UTRs, and non-coding potential regulatory regions. We will compare distributions of damaging alleles of cases and controls gene-by-gene and by network-defined functional groups. In a preliminary study, we identified novel truncating mutations in 3 different genes, each in one of 24 patients sequenced for 281 genes from a co-expression network. We use a method of pre-capture pooling and hybridization that yields a sequencing cost per complete gene per sample of 13 cents. In Aim 3, we will use C. elegans to characterize the roles of schizophrenia candidate genes in neurodevelopment. In candidate genes with orthologs in C. elegans, we will measure the consequences of RNAi-reduced expression on neurological phenotypes, including defects in axon guidance, dendritic branching, or neurotransmitter-specific neuron function. Then, for selected human mutations, we will create transgenic animals to examine the consequences of replacing the C. elegans gene with the human mutant vs normal gene. Together, these aims are designed to identify genes or clusters of genes important to schizophrenia.\n",

      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     This proposal is in response to the NHLBI's call for  Novel Methods of Monitoring Health Disparities.  The University of Wisconsin (UW) School of Medicine and Public Health (SMPH) and its partners propose to build an innovative research network to monitor the effects of economic and policy changes on cardiovascular and respiratory health in communities. The main focus will be to identify the determinants of the state's significant health inequities according to place of residence, race/ethnicity, gender, and socioeconomic status.  We will create a model information network called the Wisconsin Health Equity Network (WHEN) by linking unique existing resources that assess the health of Wisconsin individuals and communities at multiple levels. These resources include: (1) the Survey of the Health of Wisconsin (SHOW): an annual survey of representative samples of state communities and their adult residents including data on demographics, employment, medical history and health behaviors, access to health care, quality of life, as well as an individuals' physical exam and blood/urine samples; (2) the Wisconsin County Health Rankings: an annual summary of the health status of the population in all Wisconsin counties; (3) the Wisconsin Collaborative for Health Care Quality: a consortium of health care provider organizations (physician groups, health plans, hospital) sharing health care quality data; and (4) What Works-Policies and Programs to Improve Wisconsin's Health: a compendium of programs and policies that might influence health and reduce health disparities.  Funding for this program will support the expansion of the SHOW by increasing its sample size and recruitment incentives, and by adding a new rural-based field station in addition to the existing urban-based SHOW facilities in Milwaukee and Madison. It will also support the addition of a mail survey assessing health status of a representative sample of Wisconsin residents, as well as interviews with public health and health care leaders in the communities sampled each year. Methods to link the above sources of information will be developed; the use of this network of information on health, health care quality, and public health resources to assess how concurrent shifts in the global and local economy affect health disparities will be tested. Building on existing community-academic partnerships within the UW Institute for Clinical and Translational Research and the UW Population Health Institute, WHEN will engage community organizations and health professionals and will use these resources to disseminate results and identify strategies for intervention.  WHEN have national implications. It provides a finer resolution lacking in national surveys to adequately assess health disparities at the community level where multiple determinants operate. The proposed funding will leverage resources developed through a strong UW-SMPH commitment to integrate Medicine and Public Health and improve population health. Consistent with this mission, a sustainable WHEN will serve as a unique-in-the-nation model for addressing population health and health disparities.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     The Wisconsin Health Equity Network (WHEN) will expand the Survey of the Health of Wisconsin, an infrastructure for population health monitoring, and combine individual level information with data from three other organizations that monitor the quality of medical care, health care costs and public health policies in the state of Wisconsin. The Network will be a one-of-a kind model for identifying the cause of population differences in heart and lung disease, two of the most significant causes of death and disability in the United States. WHEN is built upon a population health foundation and contributes to NIH goals by enhancing public health and creating opportunities for identification of programs to reduce health inequalities.\n",

      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV dementia (HIV-D) and HIV-associated sensory neuropathy (HIV-SN) are the most common neurological manifestations of advanced HIV infection. The prevalence of HIV-D and HIV-SN in Sub- Saharan Africa where the majority of HIV cases reside globally is largely unknown. In addition, HIV subtype may have an impact on HIV disease progression, suggesting the possibility that HIV subtypes may differ with respect to their ability to cause neurological disease. The project will assemble a cohort of HIV+ individuals in Uganda: 1) to determine the prevalence of and risk factors associated with HIV-D and HIV-SN among untreated HIV+ individuals with moderate advanced immunosuppression, 2) to determine whether untreated HIV+ individuals decline from baseline in neuropsychological test performance, and peripheral nerve function, and 3) to obtain preliminary data to determine whether HIV subtypes differ with respect to the risk of HIV-D and HIV-SN, and progression of HIV-associated cognitive impairment and peripheral nerve function. We propose one of the first large scale prospective studies of HIV-D and HIV-SN in Sub-Saharan Africa. This proposal will provide the data necessary to characterize the prevalence and progression of HIV-D and HIV-SN, which could be used for future R01 applications. HIV-associated cognitive impairment is currently not an indication for HAART initiation in HIV+ individuals with a CD4 count in the 201-350 cells/Â¿L range. Our proposal will provide the data necessary to determine if clinical practice parameters for the initiation of HAART among HIV+ individuals with moderate immunosuppression and mild neurocognitive impairment should be changed in countries within Sub-Saharan Africa such as Uganda. Our proposal will examine whether HIV subtypes may differ with respect to their ability to cause HIVassociated CNS and PNS dysfunction. The proposal will also provide training for the HIV clinician-scientists in Kampala, Uganda in research studies of HIV-associated neurological disease. Based upon our preliminary data, we believe that HIV-D and HIV-SN are frequently unrecognized complications of advanced HIV infection in Sub-Saharan Africa, and are a significant cause of morbidity in HIV+ individuals in Uganda, which if identified early, can be treated effectively with antiretroviral therapy and symptomatic therapies.     PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The epidemiology of HIV dementia (HIV-D) and HIV-associated sensory neuropathy (HIV-SN) in Sub-Saharan Africa where the majority of HIV cases reside globally is largely unknown.

The Core will build on the structures developed in CREATE I for data collection, storage, transfer, and management, and quality control for the core battery. The methods developed in CREATE I will be further enhanced during the proposed CREATE II project to ensure that they reflect recent strategies in data management and that they meet the requirements of the Center's proposed research program. The Core will also assume primary responsibility for analyzing the core battery data and provide statistical and analytical support for the planned cross-site longitudinal study (see Management Core) and all subsequent cross-site projects. In addition, the Core will provide consultation to the Center's investigators on research methods and statistical analyses for all of the proposed research projects, the pilot research studies, and any  spin-off  research projects. To ensure adequate communication with Center investigators the Co-Directors of the Core will be part of the Executive Working Group of the Center (see Management Core) and participate in the monthly conference calls and Center meetings. The Co-Directors for the Core will also participate in the preparation of project reports and manuscripts and dissemination of project outcomes. Finally, the Core will help to ensure that all projects are compliant with IRB andHIPAA regulations. The Core has been structured to balance data management and analytical responsibilities. The team of investigators that has been assembled for the Core has extensive experience in advanced statistical methods, research design, programming, and simulation. The ultimate goal of the Core is to maximize the integrity and quality of the Center's data and to ensure that the outcomes of the Center are of the highest standards.\n",

      "In scattering theory, due to the complexity of material properties and uncertainty in physical models and parameters, precise modeling and accurate computing present challenging and significant mathematical and computational questions. The PI proposes to develop mathematical models, examine mathematical issues, and design computational methods for new and important classes of direct and inverse problems that arise from the acoustic and electromagnetic wave propagation in complex and random environments. The mathematical modeling techniques and computational methods developed in this project address several key scientific challenges in applied and computational mathematics, which include: (1) multi-scale modeling and computation of the wave propagation in a heterogeneous medium; (2) computational stochastic direct and inverse scattering problems; (3) numerical solution of Maxwell's equations and well-posedness of associated models; (4) global uniqueness, local stability, and numerical solution of the ill-posed inverse scattering problems. The educational plan is to foster greater awareness of the broad and important applications of mathematics so as to attract more students in pursuing a major, a minor, or a graduate degree in mathematics. The proposed education activities include: (1) undergraduate and graduate courses and curriculum development; (2) mentoring of undergraduate, graduate, and postdoc research; (3) organizing summer schools, seminars, and workshops. The dramatic growth of computational capability and the development of fast algorithms have transformed the methodology for scientific investigation and industrial applications in the field of scattering theory. Reciprocally, the practical applications and scientific developments have driven the need for more sophisticated mathematical models and numerical algorithms to describe the scattering of complicated structures, and to accurately compute acoustic and electromagnetic fields and thus to predict the performance of a given structure, as well as to carry out optimal design of new structures. The proposed computational models and tools are highly promising for qualitative and quantitative study of the complex physical and mathematical problems in optics and electromagnetics, and provide an inexpensive and easily controllable virtual prototype of the structures in the design and fabrication of optical and  electromagnetic devices. The research is multidisciplinary by nature and lies at the interface of mathematics, physics, engineering, and materials sciences. In addition, it has significant potential to advance the frontiers of applied and computational mathematics, and even to have impact on other branches of science.\n",

      "White blood cells called T lymphocytes play critical roles in immune defense against viruses, bacteria, fungi, protozoa, and cancer cells. In the unactivated state, these cells circulate in the blood and accumulate in lymphoid tissues such as lymph nodes and spleen. Upon encounter with foreign materials (antigens) on the membranes of specialized antigen presenting cells (dendritic cells), these resting T-cells become activated, undergo numerous cell divisions, and differentiate into effector cells. The effector cells leave the lymphoid tissues and blood, entering sites of infection to combat pathogens. They can also invade normal tissues where their activity can cause autoimmune pathology. After elimination of an infecting organism, most of the activated T-cells die, but some remain as memory cells, to provide a more rapid and vigorous response if the same pathogen is encountered in the future. Recent work has suggested that this general scheme applies to both CD4 and CD8 T-cells, but that there are also important differences in the signals that control the extent of proliferation and the survival of memory cells for these two T-cell lineages. Furthermore, there are also data suggesting that memory cells may be of more than one type, with some recirculating in lymphoid compartments and others patrolling peripheral tissues. The former may provide the major source of new cells upon re-infection, whereas the latter may mediate the earliest effector response to the infection. The proper balance of both types may be critical for effective T-cell mediated host defense. Other lymphocytes such as NK cells and regulatory T cells contribute to both the enhancement and suppression of these T cell responses through direct and indirect means. This project attempts to gain both a qualitative (especially tissue-specific 4 dimensional  space and time) and a quantitative understanding of the activation, differentiation, migration, cell-cell interaction, memory status, and reactivation properties of both CD4 and CD8 T-cells. Issues such as the route, amount, and frequency of antigen exposure, as well as the presence or absence of adjuvants that stimulate the innate immune system, are being studied for their effects on the generation and tissue distribution of effector and memory CD4 and CD8 T-cells. The movement of activated T-cells into non-lymphoid tissues is being analyzed using both conventional cellular immunological methods and newer imaging techniques that allow high resolution dynamic observation of how cells migrate, interact, and carry out their effector functions. Through this research, a better understanding of lymphocyte dynamics during an immune response to infection or after vaccination or during an autoimmune response will be established. These new insights can contribute to the more effective design of vaccines and to strategies for the amelioration of autoimmune processes.We have established a robust system for vaccination using the non-replicating pox vector MVA, to permit in situ analysis of immune cell behavior in response to a clinically used vaccine vector. Variants of the virus have been developed that encode both fluorescent proteins and model antigens that are recognized by TCR transgenic T cells expressing distinct fluorescent proteins. This allows for tracking of the sites of viral infection and of the location and dynamic behavior of antigen-specific T cells during immune responses in situ, using our advanced 2-photon intravital imaging methods. Preliminary studies have suggested unexpected locations for some of the cells initially infected by MVA within draining lymph nodes, potentially distinct cells involved in initial antigen presentation to CD4 T cells vs. CD8 T cells, the rapid loss of directly infected cells, a role for cross-presentation as well as direct presentation in the activation of CD8 T cells, and different locations of naive vs. memory CD8 T cells in the lymph node. In the case of the distinct sites of CD4 and CD8 T cell antigen engagement, we are now trying to understand how what appears to be dispersed initial antigen activation of these two cell types on different antigen-presenting cells can be reconciled with data from other laboratories and from the LBS that indicate a requirement for antigen co-presentation to the CD8 and CD4 T cells on the same dendritic cells for induction of robust immune memory. We have also utilized this model for examine the effect of regulatory T cells (Tregs) on the MVA-induced response and have obtained data showing a striking differential effect of these cells on CD8 T cells, especially with respect the balance of highly polarized effectors versus multifunctional/ memory T cells emerging after priming. We have dissected the mechanism of the suppression of effector generation by Tregs, revealing a key role for limitation in the late (post-activation) availability of the cytokine IL-2. In other experiments building on a combination of our highly multiplexed immunofluorescence imaging and our 2-photon intravital methods, we have accumulated data on the delivery of antigen from subcutaneous sites to the draining lymph node and the role of distinct subpopulations of macrophages and dendritic cells in acquiring the antigen in different regions of the lymph node. With respect to effector function, a combination of intravital imaging and flow cytometry studies in a model of delayed-type hypersensitivity have revealed that effector cells in an inflamed, not tolerogenic, site undergo a single round of activation to cytokine secretion status in concert with an arrest of migration, followed by a loss of cytokine production as the cells mobilize from the antigen presenting cell and resume rapid movement in the tissue that lasts as long as we can image (>10 hours). These data imply a mechanism of tuning of effector cells upon initial activation in the tissue that limits damaging cytokine production if the antigen load is not increasing, and also suggests that eventual elimination of a pathogen will depend on a constant influx of new effectors from secondary lymphoid tissue. Preliminary data suggest that a negative feedback loop involving regulatory surface proteins whose expression increases shortly after antigen stimulation of effector T cells in the tissue depresses signaling through the TCR and hence, desensitizes the T cells with respect to the available antigen level.We are continuing our studies of activated T cell help for humoral antibody responses from B cells, with a focus on the generation and behavior of follicular helper CD4 T cells (Tfh). New reporter systems are being developed to track these cells and to characterize their dynamic and functional interactions with B cells in the interfollicular region and especially within germinal centers. Progress has been made in the initial steps of constructing and validating a novel reporter of Bcl6 protein expression (rather than gene transcription).Finally, we have developed new data suggesting that the in vitro paradigm of autocrine cytokine-induced polarization of CD4+ T cells is an oversimplification of the in vivo reality.  In particular, both in vitro and in vivo, under suitable conditions, Th1 and Th2 effector T cells can be generated in the absence of the canonical cytokine (IFNgamma and IL-4, respectively), or the relevant STAT protein. A key determinant of the fate of the T cells is the strength of signaling through the T cell antigen receptor, and in vivo, preliminary data suggest that changes to dendritic cell morphology and capacity for cell-cell interactions plays an important role in determining the strength of signaling to T cells and their ultimate polarized fate.\n",

      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): My goal for the K25 award is to establish myself as an independent neuroimaging researcher with expertise in brain network analysis and an integral member of multidisciplinary research teams devoted to addressing diseases of the brain. Attaining these objectives will require focused didactic training and research guidance. Research We will develop new methodology to improve whole-brain connectivity analyses of normal and abnormal brain function. The launching of the Human Connectome Project by the NIH in 2009 underscores the importance of whole-brain connectivity analyses. Appropriately conducting these analyses is paramount in our understanding normal brain function as well as alterations due to conditions such as aging, dyslexia, and substance abuse. Before we can glean useful information from functional brain network differences in these conditions, methods need to be developed in order to permit 1) assessing several network properties simultaneously while also accounting for the complex dependence structure of the networks; 2) making predictions about the presence and strength (weight) of connections between brain regions based on disease status; 3) determining whether task related changes in brain networks are associated with clinical outcomes. The novel methods proposed here will address these needs, providing more appropriate techniques for the emerging area of whole-brain connectivity analysis. This research, along with my proposed training experiences and strong mentoring team, will facilitate my progression toward becoming an independent neuroimaging researcher with expertise in brain network analysis and enable me to make unique contributions to brain research. Training The proposed training plan consists of four elements: 1) a didactic component aimed at establishing a basic foundation in computational neuroscience and image analysis; 2) career guidance in methodological development and collaborative neuroimaging research through planned on and off-site mentoring by neuroscientists and network and neuroimaging statisticians; 3) conducting innovative research utilizing the gained neuroscientific and image analytic knowledge and previous statistical training; and 4) participating in the exchange of ideas in statistics and the neurosciences through conference and workshop attendance. The planned training activities will focus on deepening my understanding of the brain as a complex system, enabling me to reasonably model and evaluate this system within its biological context. The combination of my knowledge in network-based brain imaging statistics, computational neuroscience, and image analysis will be a valuable asset that will not be confined to a single brain disorder. While the data analyses proposed here will focus on aging and brain degeneration, dyslexia, and substance abuse, the skills and knowledge that I will gain will position me to collaborate with investigators that study a broad range of clinical brain disorders.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: My goal for the K25 award is to establish myself as an independent neuroimaging researcher with expertise in brain network analysis and an integral member of multidisciplinary research teams devoted to addressing diseases of the brain. The training activities will focus on deepening my understanding of the brain as a complex system, enabling me to reasonably model and evaluate this system in a biologically meaningful way. The research activities will focus on developing new methodology and modifying existing methods in order to improve whole-brain connectivity analyses of normal and abnormal brain function.\n",

      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The success of neuronal cell replacement therapy depends on the ability of transplanted cells to synaptically integrate with host tissue. Complete integration requires that neurons can both send and receive synaptic information, as well as to modify their synaptic strength in response to changes in the cellular behavior of synaptically connected neurons. Due to limited cell tracking and stimulation techniques, previous reports have shown only that transplanted neurons can receive information from host neurons via synaptic stimulation. Thus, no direct evidence exists for their ability to send information to host cells or undergo synaptic plasticity. To test these hypotheses, we propose to use the light-activated Channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) ion channel linked to the mCherry fluorophore in human embryonic stem cell (hESC)-derived neurons. Following transplantation of hESC-derived forebrain-patterned neurons to the mouse hippocampus, we will use light stimulation to selectively activate human neurons while recording mouse cells. We hypothesize that light stimulation (and subsequent action potential generation) will give rise to robust synaptic activation of host neurons. Application of various light stimulus protocols will then test whether human neurons can trigger short-term and long-term forms of synaptic plasticity in host cells. In parallel, we will perform similar experiments on mixed cultures of ChR2-expressing and non-expressing hESC-derived neurons. Here, application of light stimulation protocols will test whether hESC-derived neurons can undergo post-synaptic changes required for enduring changes in synaptic efficacy. Together, these data seek to provide evidence of the ability of human neurons to act as a fully functional unit within a neural network in host tissues.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Successful neuronal cell replacement is thought to rely on the integration of transplanted cells with host tissue via the formation of synaptic connections. Until recently, technical limitations have prevented the determination of whether stem cell-derived neurons can send information to host cells or undergo changes in synaptic efficacy that are necessary for true circuit integration. The proposed research will use the newly characterized light activated Channelrhodopsin-2 in human embryonic cell-derived neurons to regulate the excitability of transplanted neurons to test these hypotheses.\n",

      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Membrane proteins confound anything less than exceptionally heroic attempts aimed at solving their structures. The conventional approaches to membrane protein overexpression, purification, and crystallization typically fail due to problems with insolubility and folding. This project leverages large libraries of soluble and highly crystallizable proteins to identify binding partners for membrane proteins. Selectants from these libraries will provide affinity reagents for membrane protein co-expression, affinity purification and co-crystallization. Co-expression with the binding partner could help avoid membrane protein aggregation, and allow protein folding to take place. Affinity chromatography with the binding partner is aimed at assisting membrane protein purification, and co-crystallization aims to slow protein aggregation and precipitation during formation of crystals. The first specific aimfocuses on design and construction of phage-displayed protein libraries for high affinity binding to membrane proteins. Strategic choice of proteins for library formation, such as the highly crystallizable protein lysozyme and the exceptionally soluble protein S-crystallin, for phage display will help insure the success of the project; additional libraries specifically tailored forG-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) include variants of G- proteins and GPCR ligands. To obtain high affinity binding, thermal stability, solubility, and other properties, the second specific aimfeatures a flow path of selections and screens. In the third specific aim, the affinity reagents from phage display are applied to the production of membrane proteins and their crystallization. By binding to and essentially freezing specific conformations of the membrane protein, the affinity reagents could offer powerful tools both for structural biology, but also other structure-function studies of membrane proteins. In summary, this proposal will define new approaches to protein engineering and molecular recognition, through development of new fusion proteins and their use in the recognition of membrane proteins.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Membrane proteins represent an extraordinarily important class of proteins associated with many diseases and targeted by roughly 40% of therapeutics. Yet, despite their biomedical importance, structures of membrane proteins are relatively rare due to problems with their insolubility and crystallizability. This proposal harnesses classes of proteins known to exhibit great solubility and crystallizability as reagents designed to bind, stabilize, and expedite determination of membrane protein structures.\n",

      "A distinctive characteristic of human learning is its capability to flexibly acquire a wide range of rich and complex forms of knowledge (e.g., first and second languages) and acquiring new and accumulated knowledge (e.g., learning physics is easier after having learned algebra). An adequate explanation of human learning must address how existing knowledge changes the way we learn so that we achieve knowledge goals and in specific contexts. This project aims to discover and specify how human learning processes operate differently under different contexts, depending upon what content is being learned. This research contributes to improved educational practices by specifying how learning processes are influenced by knowledge acquisition in a systematic and replicable way. This research will enhance our understanding of successful learning and optimal performance.The project explores learning processes by contrasting learning from retrieval practice and learning from studying examples. The goal of this project is to resolve and clarify how these processes compete for cognitive resources, including attention and working memory, in ways that depend on the knowledge content to be learned. This research examines (1) the learning processes involved in learning from retrieval practice and from worked examples, (2) how these learning processes work differently when applied to different knowledge content, and (3) the computational mechanisms of learning that give rise to learning different content. The researchers use a combination of experiments in which the learning approach is varied along with the materials being studied and machine learning models. It will demonstrate knowledge-learning dependence by showing that one learning process (e.g., retrieval practice) produces better learning outcomes than another (e.g., example encoding) in some knowledge contexts but the reverse occurs in other knowledge contexts. By implementing the studies as part of a machine learning architecture, this research will provide computational evidence and theoretical insight into the hypothesized knowledge-learning dependence framework. The machine learning architecture developed may be used as an educational and research tool in learning sciences, and the project involves training new learning scientists.This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\n",

      "ï»¿   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Viruses create cellular conditions conducive to their own replication by harnessing or inactivating cellular machinery. Since viruses possess small genomes that do not encode all the factors required for DNA replication, they rely on host cell proteins to propagate their genomes. Active recruitment of cellular proteins to viral replication compartments functions to promote virus replication. In contrast, viral early proteins target antiviral cellular DNA sensors and transcriptional repressors to prevent their access to viral genomes. Identifying host factors that facilitate or limit virus DNA replication has been hampered by the lack of technologies, and only a limited number of cellular proteins have been shown to affect virus replication. Our long-term goal is to understand how cells respond to virus genomes, and to define ways that early viral proteins overcome cellular restrictions to promote virus replication. In this application we use Adenovirus infection as a model system, and employ a novel technology to identify cellular proteins that associate with replicating viral DNA genomes. Our central hypothesis is that viral proteins selectively recruit cellular DNA replication/repair factors onto viral genomes to function with viral-encoded replication factors, while also targeting specific host antiviral factors to prevent their access to viral genomes. We propose that viral early E1b and E4 gene products overcome host responses and achieve their pleiotropic functions by influencing the cellular proteins recruited to virus genomes. These viral early proteins facilitate viral DNA replication, RNA processing, protein expression, and progeny production, but their substrates are currently poorly understood. We employ novel proteomic approaches to identify host factors that interact with these viral early proteins, and determine how they impact the landscape of host factors that recognize viral DNA. Guided by strong preliminary data, we propose three Specific Aims to identify host factors recruited or inactivated by viral early proteins and determine their impact on virus DNA replication. Aim 1: To determine how host factors associated with replicating viral genomes impact infection. Aim 2: To define cellular responses across the Ad family. Aim 3: To determine how E1b55K interacting proteins impact virus infection. These studies employ innovative approaches to provide a comprehensive view of cellular responses to foreign DNA genomes replicating in the host cell nucleus. We anticipate that our results will identify proteins recruited to aid viral replication, as well as wys viral proteins manipulate host responses. Identifying cellular proteins commonly exploited for viral DNA replication across different viruses will suggest potential targets for development of novel broadly acting antiviral therapeutics. Our studies provide insights into cellular sensors of foreign DNA, and these will guide development of improved gene delivery vectors, viral oncolytics, and antiviral therapies.\n",

      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Continuous replacement and repair of adult epithelial tissues such as the skin, intestine, and lung depend on self-renewing stem cells which generate the specialized cells necessary for tissue maintenance. Recent work has shown that the local environment, or niche, in which stem cells reside is critical for their maintenance and function. Specifically, positioning of the stem cell within the niche exposes it to signals that promote its survival and maintenance and guide the production of specialized daughter cells that perform the normal tissue functions. Self-renewing cells that possess many normal stem cell properties have been identified in tumors, emphasizing that defining stem cell control mechanisms in normal tissues is important for understanding how stem cells contribute to cancer. Conversely, the idea of using stem cell therapeutics to treat diseases associated with stem cell loss, such as diabetes, and devastating injuries to tissues including the brain, spinal cord, or skin has generated enormous excitement. However, our lack of understanding of the mechanisms that regulate stem cells within their normal niches in vivo has hampered the advancement of these therapies for clinical applications.  The goal of our proposed study is to understand how localized signals promote stem cell specification and maintenance within the niche. In mammals, like mice or humans, major technical challenges have made it difficult to identify adult stem cells within tissues, a problem that has prevented the identification of important signals that control stem cell behavior. Because of this, we are using the developing ovary in the fruit fly as a model system to directly examine epithelial stem cell regulation. Rapid progress has already been made in identifying components of the stem cell niche and specific genes that control stem cell behavior. Importantly, the genes identified so far also regulate stem cells in humans, suggesting that identifying new signals that control fly stem cell function will be broadly relevant.  Using the fly ovary system, we recently found that integrins, a group of proteins that anchor cells in place, are important for maintaining epithelial Follicle Stem Cells (FSCs) within their niche. Without integrins, FSCs change shape, improperly divide and migrate, and lose their ability to function as stem cells. Similar defects are thought to contribute to cancer initiation, promotion, and progression in humans. Our data also demonstrates that FSCs produce a protein that is an important niche component. This novel finding suggests that many types of stem cells, perhaps including cancer stem cells, may have the capacity to initiate their own niche. The experiments proposed will define 1) how integrins participate in FSC regulation and 2) identify important genes and proteins that work together with integrins to control stem cell function. The outcome of these experiments will impact our understanding of epithelial stem cell function in general and also will have important implications for the development of techniques aimed at purifying stem cells for therapeutic use.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Our present aim is to define epithelial stem cell control mechanisms in the fly ovary, where specific stem cell regulatory genes and their functions will be determined using genetics, live imaging, and developmental techniques. Defining stem cell control mechanisms in normal tissues is important for understanding how stem cells contribute to cancer and for developing stem cell therapeutics to treat developmental defects, traumatic injury, or diseases associated with stem cell loss, including diabetes.\n",

      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed experiments will continue to assess consequences of early exposure to ethanol for responsiveness to ethanol later in development. In view of epidemiological evidence for relatively frequent exposure to ethanol among human infants as well as fetuses, and clinical evidence that prenatal exposure to ethanol in humans predicts ethanol abuse in adolescence and early adulthood, the proposed experiments are relevant to issues of adolescent initiation to ethanol as well as more proximal consequences of early ethanol exposure. Three circumstances of early ethanol exposure to be studied are in the form of three specific aims: (1) To examine consequences of fetal processing of ethanol's chemosensory attributes and those of a learned association between them and ethanol's pharmacological effects; (2) To determine consequences of postnatal nursing experience involving ethanol for subsequent responsiveness to ethanol's chemosensory attributes, sensitivity to ethanol's postabsorptive effects and self-administration of ethanol; (3) To assess longitudinally the interactive consequences of prenatal and early postnatal exposure to ethanol for subsequent ethanol sensitivity and learning about ethanol during the preadolescent and adolescent periods. Experiments will apply techniques developed and previously employed in our laboratories, providing a combination of relatively new methods of treatment and assessment with methods used for many years. The experiments will include systematic assessment of: fetal associative learning supported by the reinforcing effects of ethanol during prenatal ethanol exposure and the consequences for postnatal responsiveness to ethanol; the consequences of ethanol exposure during nursing for later responsiveness to ethanol, novel environments and motor challenges; and conditioned and unconditioned effects of combined ethanol exposure as a fetus and as a nursing infant on later learning about ethanol, acceptance of ethanol and response to socially induced acceptance of ethanol. Theoretical orientation for considering the consequences of early ethanol exposure is focused on learning induced by that exposure and motivational content of related early memories. Special concern is given to specific temporal windows following ethanol exposure that yield memories of specific motivational associates, and the effect of multiple, potentially interactive exposures to ethanol for later patterns of ethanol recognition and acceptance\n",

The small animal imaging facility at UNC currently houses nine major imaging equipments, including MRI (2), PET/CT (1), CT (1), SPECT (1), optical imaging (3), and ultrasound (1). In addition, skillful technical staff members to maintain and operate the imaging equipments and animal technicians to facilitate animal preparation for imaging and monitoring during imaging are available. Leveraging on these impressive resources, the small animal imaging (SAI) core aims to provide advanced imaging technology to facilitate the proposed projects. Specifically, two major imaging tasks will be carried out for the proposed projects, including to depict biodistribution of nanoparticles (Projects 1, 2, and 3) and to monitor and evaluate therapeutic efficacy of the proposed nanoparticles or treatment regimens (Projects 2, 3, and 4) using imaging methods. To accomplish the former task, both PET and optical imaging methods will be developed to more efficiently and accurately provide biodistribution information. For the latter task, four imaging modalities, including optical, CT, PET, and MRI will be used to monitor therapeutic efficacy. Finally, while the imaging capability in the small animal imaging facility is already impressive, our institution has committed additional funds to further augment the imaging program at UNC, including the establishment of an on-site cyclotron facility and the associated radiochemistry lab and the development of imaging registration approaches for multimodality imaging using microCT, MRI, and PET (Projects 2, 3 and 4). Together, we believe that the available technical expertise and well established infrastructure in the small animal imaging facility will greatly facilitate the success ofthe proposed projects.\n",

      "The discovery of antibiotics nearly 80 years ago was a major milestone in the battle against infectious disease, yet bacterial infections continue to be a significant cause of death worldwide. In fact, management of many bacterial infections is becoming progressively more difficult due to the emergence of new and rapidly evolving pathogens with increased virulence, resistance to antibiotics, a greater ability to evade host responses, and heightened transmissibility. To reverse this trend, a systematic understanding of the complex dynamics between the pathogen and host is needed at every level of interaction, including those between cells, individuals, microbial communities, and populations. We will develop and implement an integrated experimental framework that provides systematic and complementary insights into bacterial infections encompassing single cells, animal models, and human patients, to investigate cellular genomics, transcriptional networks, and host microecologies. Three of the most deadly and costly bacterial pathogens will be used as examples to develop this framework and probe the host-pathogen interaction. Specifically, we will dissect the interaction between Mycobacterium tuberculosis and its host at the single cell level to gain a deep and highly resolved characterization of the host cellular states that contribute to susceptibility to infection. We will follow the dynamics of uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) infection in animals and humans to gain insights into the role of UPEC, the host and the host microbiome in the persistence of recurrent urinary tract infections. We will track the movement and evolution of carbapenem resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) as they emerge in patient populations contributing critical details about how CRE and the resistance elements that they carry are transmitted among patients and patient populations. There are two goals of this work. One is to develop an adaptable framework of multi-omic approaches to be applied to a wide-range of pathogens for the dissection of bacterial infection at the single cell, infected individual and clinical population levels. The second is to capitalize on the output from this framework to identify points\n",

ObjectiveThe objective of the Data Management and Analysis Core is to continue to provide data managementservices and statistical expertise to Program Project investigators in a wide range of data acquisition andanalysis activities. Integral to the goals of each project is the management and analysis of Core observational,interview, questionnaire, and behavioral data, as well as management and analysis of data from the individualprojects. Data management activities draw on the considerable resources of the Data Management andAnalysis Center (DMAC) at the Frank Porter Graham Child Development Center (FPG) at UNC and TheMethodology Center (TMC) at PSD. Specific Aims of the Data Management and Analysis Core are to:1) Implement the planned missing design in conjunction with the Executive Committee.2) Develop and maintain data management strategies that process data collected in the common protocol andthe individual projects efficiently and accurately.3) Design and maintain integrated databases of project and common protocol data.4) Develop and implement data analysis plans using innovative analytic methods for longitudinal dataincluding variable-centered and person-centered approaches to address research questions incollaboration with project investigators.5) To set in place a data archiving system for data sharing.These goals require the collaboration of experienced statisticians and computer programmers. The DMACprogrammers have expertise in all aspects of quantitative data management, from the entry and tracking ofdata to the generation of analysis files and statistical programming. The DMAC and TMC statisticianscollaborated with these and other investigators regarding design and statistical issues across many earlychildhood research projects. The Data Management and Analysis Core provides high level expertise to theProgram Project in each of these areas. The use of an experienced data acquisition and analysis center toprocess and analyze data across the projects will provide both high levels of quality control and costeffectiveness.A central data acquisition and analysis center is especially important for this Program Project because datafrom each project contributes to the common protocol for use by all projects in addressing their hypotheses.In particular, executive functioning and self regulation measures collected by Project I, classroom observationsand child cognitive/academic outcomes collected by Project II, and family process measures collected byProject III, and community measures from the core are primary predictor or outcome measures used inanalyses by all projects. Central coordination of data processing and analysis will ensure the consistent andtimely processing of these Â¿data^for-all- inyestigatgrsv Careful documentation of data scoring, including the reliability and distributions of summary variables, will facilitate the use of one project's data by other projectinvestigators.The services provided by the Data Management and Analysis Core pertain to almost all phases of theresearch including design, data collection, data entry, and analysis. The main advantage of having acentralized facility for data management and computing is the ability to provide coordinated services thataddress the wide range of issues involved in these activities. By coordinating data processing activities for allprojects, duplication of effort is reduced, efficiencies of data management and analyses are generated, andopportunities for higher level analysis across data sets from different projects are made available. Thus,maximum communication is obtained across all projects to further the understanding of data to be analyzed, aswell as the statistical procedures for those analyses. Furthermore, synergy among projects is enhancedthrough having the same programmers and statisticians working across projects.\n",

      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study (FFS) is a nationally representative, birth cohort study of approximately 4900 children born in large US cities (populations of 200,000 or more) between 1998 and 2000. The study includes: (1) interviews with mothers and fathers at birth and again when children are 1, 3, 5 and 9 years old, (2) medical records for a subset of mothers and children at birth, (3) in-home assessments of children and their home environments when children are 3, 5, and 9 years old, (4) interviews with children at age 9, (5) interviews with teachers when children are 3, 5, and 9 years old and (6) DNA samples from mothers and children when children are age 9. The study also includes in-depth, longitudinal interviews with a subset of approximately 75 couples during the first four years after the child's birth. The study design called for a large oversample of births to unmarried parents, and thus the data are a valuable resource for studying health disparities among minority and economically disadvantaged populations. To date, more than 1300 researchers have downloaded the public use data, and Google Scholar lists 730 scholarly articles, theses, books, and abstracts using the FFS data for the period covered by the current NICHD grant, 2006-2011. We seek funding to conduct another round of interviews with mothers and children when children are 15 years old. Our specific aims are to:   Update information on children's health and development and collect new data on health and health risk behavior, school performance, and anti- and pro-social behavior when children are age 15   Update information on contextual factors, including families, neighborhoods, schools and peers, when children are age 15, including retrospective data on family experiences since the last interview  Collect saliva samples from 3,600 children at age 15 to be used for future methylation analysis Approximately 3600 mothers and 3100 children will be interviewed via phone. These phone interviews will be 55 minutes for mothers and 45 minutes for children. Five hundred adolescents will be interviewed in person for approximately 1 hour.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will extend the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study (FFS), a nationally representative, birth cohort study of approximately 4900 children born in large US cities (populations of 200,000 or more) between 1998 and 2000, by collecting data from mothers and adolescents when the children are 15 years old on children's health and health risk behavior, school performance, and anti- and pro-social behavior; on contextual factors, including families, neighborhoods, schools, and peers; and on methylation using saliva samples from 3600 children at age 15. Adolescence is a critical period in human development when children engage in both positive and negative behaviors that are known to have lasting consequences for future health and wellbeing. The new data will dramatically increase our knowledge of how children's experiences in early and middle childhood influence adolescent behaviors and, ultimately, health and wellbeing in adulthood.\n",

We view these multitasking proteins as potential control nodes that may integrate DNA damage-specific signals and marshal the appropriate repair process(es) to the sites of DNA damage.

Our immediate efforts are focused on 1) defining the mechanism of substrate selection by mammalian DNA ligase III in DNA damage responses, 2) creating a  chemical genetic switch  to shut off the NER pathway in order to explore other diverse functions of the repair endonuclease ERCC1-XPF, and 3) the enzymatic regulation of Sir2, a protein deacetylase with diverse activities, including DNA repair functions. We are using a structure-based approach to develop small molecule modulators of protein- protein interactions and enzymatic activities that can ultimately be used to probe the physical interactions and functional crosstalk between DNA repair pathways in living cells. Inhibitors of DNA repair activities may ultimately be useful in treating cancers that have become resistant to DNA crosslinkers, alkylating agents, and other DNA-targeted therapies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We are studying how damaged DNA is repaired. These repair processes are essential for the normal maintenance of our genetic blueprint, but they can also cause resistance to anti-cancer drugs that kill tumors by inflicting damage to DNA. A better understanding of basic DNA repair mechanisms could lead to the development of drugs used to temporarily switch off repair during cancer chemotherapy.\n",

      "The residents of the study area, approximately 8000 people aged at least 5 years, have participated in a longitudinal population study since 1965, allowing study of the risk factors and effects of diabetes mellitus. Risk factors for obesity, hypertension, and nephropathy are also studied, along with the relationships of these diseases to diabetes and their effects on development of vascular complications and mortality. The genetics of diabetes is studied by means of family studies and relationships of genetic markers to disease. The roles of obesity, serum insulin concentrations, impaired glucose regulation, occupational and leisure-time physical activity and diabetes in relatives are assessed.  Findings on risk factors for diabetes are applied to a multicenter randomized clinical trial of prevention of type 2 diabetes that is currently in a long-term outcomes phase (the Diabetes Prevention Program Outcomes Study).  Studies of the genetics of type 2 diabetes, obesity, and diabetes complications are described in other projects.Knowledge of diabetes risk factors coming from this and other studies led to the hypothesis that type 2 diabetes could be prevented or delayed in adults at high short-term risk.  This hypothesis was confirmed in the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP), a multicenter randomized clinical trial in which many of the participants and investigators in this project participated.  We are now in a long-term follow-up phase, the Diabetes Prevention Program Outcomes Study (DPPOS), to assess long-term success with weight loss, reduction in the incidence of diabetes, and effects on diabetes complications.  The DPPOS also began a genetics component to test whether genes with known or suspected effects on type 2 diabetes affected diabetes incidence in the DPP and interacted with study interventions.\n",

      "PROJECT SUMMARYThe formation of a malignant tumor from a benign tumor has been strongly linked to the existence ofheterogeneous cellular features within the tumor. Thus, elucidating the mechanisms underlying generation oftumor cell heterogeneity will be an important milestone to understand malignant tumor formation. We believetwo applications of our work could be 1) earlier, more quantitative detection of malignancy based on molecularmarkers and 2) therapeutics that can freeze tumor development before metastasis or even revert back to abenign state. Our approach is to answer the following two questions:1. What is the impact of the tumor-initiating cellâs identity on generating tumor cell heterogeneity?In experiments to date, the inability to avoid contamination of different cell origins, including tissue stem cellsand non-stem cells into the resultant tumor mass has prevented identification of the precise molecularmechanisms. We address the contamination problem by establishing an experimental system that enablesprecise tracing of tumor cell lineage derived from single cells. Our method is the non-invasive, in vivo imaging ofendogenous, single cell-derived tumor development in adult transparent zebrafish. This experimental systemallows us to visualize individual tumor cells, and, more importantly, also selectively label and isolate the cells ofinterest for detailed cell characterization. Using this system, we have already imaged the tumors arising fromsingle cells in the skin epithelium. Importantly, we have found some major differences in tumor cell proliferationbetween tumorous cell clusters and in tumor cell differentiation that lead to acquisition of invasive features. Ourresults identifying a subset of tumor cells displaying invasive features is nicely representing the generation oftumor cell heterogeneity within a tumor. We will perform long-term clonal analysis of tumor development andtranscriptome analysis of isolated individual tumors to determine their cellular identity. Retrospective imaginganalysis will be used to study the effect of a tumorâs microenvironment on generating tumor cell heterogeneity.2. How is heterogeneity within a tumor established?Identification of the cell types of tumor-initiating cells will be followed by the investigation of the mechanismsdriving a single tumor-initiating cell to become heterogeneous during multiple rounds of cell divisions. Our abilityto distinctively label and isolate invasive tumor cells from non-invasive tumor cells enables us to investigate thegene expression modulations responsible for a subset of tumor cells acquiring invasive features during tumordevelopment. We will further perform functional experiments in vivo to define the roles of specific molecularpathways in tumor invasion.\n",

      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Older adults are at increased risk to develop prolonged pain and experience greater pain-related loss of physical and psychosocial function compared to younger cohorts. We propose that changes in endogenous pain modulatory capacity accounts for increased incidence of pain and disability in older adults. That endogenous pain modulation dysfunction is related to persistent pain is supported by a number of studies comparing chronic pain patients with healthy controls using a  pain-inhibition-by-pain  experimental model. Although this research group (and others) has shown age deficiencies using the  pain inhibits pain  model, other human laboratory models that are known to engage pain modulatory systems have not been tested across the lifespan, each potentially involving different mechanisms. The overarching goal of the proposed research is to characterize age-related changes in pain inhibitory and facilitatory function and to investigate the biopsychosocial mediators and clinical relevance of these changes. Our preliminary data suggest that sophisticated psychophysical methods reflecting net inhibitory or facilitatory effects are sensitive to changes across the lifespan and will provide a more comprehensive and clinically-relevant picture of changes in pain processing associated with aging. This proposed study will enroll 180 human subjects, ages 18-79, who will undergo assessment during three pain modulatory sessions at baseline. The pain modulatory tests will include inhibitory protocols; diffuse noxious controls and offset analgesia, and tests that involve pain facilitation; temporal summation, impaired decay of subthreshold pain (proxy for central sensitization), and a prolonged protocol which we have found produces greater temporal sensitization across repeated trials in older subjects. Individualized temperatures for the contact heat test stimulus will be used so that subjects experience similar, moderate levels of pain. We hypothesize that age will be associated with poorer endogenous pain inhibition from pain inhibitory protocols and increased pain from protocols that facilitate pain. A range of biopsychosocial markers will be measured that we hypothesize will mediate the association between age and variability in pain modulation. These measures include psychosocial factors (catastrophizing, sleep, stress, and negative emotions) and biological markers (blood pressure, 2-endorphin, cortisol, and other hypothalamic-pituitary- adrenal and immune markers). After establishing individual levels of pain facilitation and pain inhibition, we will assess pain during daily life and the impact of pain on quality of life using a series of telephone interviews and novel real-time electronic data capture each month for 6 months. We expect that changes in our pain modulatory tests will account for observed age differences in pain frequency, more pain intensity, number of pain sites, and in quality of life.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Older persons are at greater risk of developing prolonged pain, and when they do, they suffer a greater impact of pain on quality of life than younger persons. This study will employ cutting-edge pain testing techniques to test for changes in pain inhibitory capacity, which we hypothesize contribute to increased incidence of pain and disability in older adults. As a public health problem, the increase in numbers of elders expected in our nation's population in the coming decades render understand the mechanism behind increased pain among older adults a compelling area for research\n",

      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This SBIR Phase I project will develop novel polymers as a drug delivery carrier for pharmacological applications. The carrier is a highly-structured copolymer that can form micelle-like structures with the drug in aqueous media. The polymer/drug micelle contains specially tailored interaction functionalities for drug encapsulation and slow release. The features of this type of molecular structure will minimize early degradation of the encapsulated drug and the polymer carriers are fully diodegradable. The polymer/drug micelles will exhibit uniform size and drug loading levels, and a predictable, well-controlled drug release rate.  The overall objective in the Phase I program is to develop a drug delivery system based on the proposed copolymer for pharmacological applications, and to demonstrate the enhanced drug encapsulation capability and biodegradbility as a drug delivery carrier. The specific technical aims are: 1) to synthesize and characterize represenative polymer drug carriers; 2) to demonstrate the encapsulation of special drugs and slow drug release rate; and 3) to determine the polymer's biocompatibility.  Potential markets for drug delivery are highly significant. Many of these drugs have stability problems and undesirable side effects. With this proposed new drug delivery system, more efficient drug delivery with lower dosage is possible.  This will reduce untoward side effects and enable efficient drug therapy for disease treatment.    Public Health Relevance: This SBIR Phase I project will develop polymer drug delivery carrier for pharmacological applications such as anticancer treatment. The polymer/drug medication will minimize early degradation of the encapsulated drug and decrease harmful side-effects from premature drug release.\n",

Research in Solid State and Materials Chemistry spans the full spectrum of exploration from constituent atoms, to bonding, to physical properties in extended materials. The strong links to physical properties and the functional behavior of materials is a key aspect that distinguishes solid state and materials chemists from other practitioners of chemistry, physics, and materials science: a unique approach that includes inorganic and organic materials research, incorporating both crystalline and amorphous materials, and probed at the deepest level. The goal is frequently to achieve the desired physical properties in materials that enable a given application. In this context, we employ the term Materials by Design (MbD) to refer to research that seeks to create new materials for specific applications by design. The materials may range from solution-prepared nanoparticles, to small-molecule and polymer advanced electronic materials, to organic/inorganic hybrid materials, bulk oxides, main-group compounds, and intermetallics.  One of the central goals of MbD is to make extensive routine use of computational techniques applied at multiple length scales to understand and predict new materials properties. Clearly, a vision for MbD needs to be inclusive and would rely heavily on collaboration with allied disciplines within Condensed Matter Physics (CMP) and Materials Science which will be discussed at this workshop.NON-TECHNICALThe workshop offers the opportunity for junior and senior researchers from the disciplines of chemistry, condensed matter physics, theory and materials science to come together and discuss new mechanisms for working together to advance the concept of Materials by Design.   The outcome of the workshop will be better approaches to materials discovery and a path to restoring the US to a position of preeminence in this area.\n",

      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goal of this project is to identify mechanisms that protect the nervous system from aging and neurodegenerative disorders. Aging precipitates dramatic alterations in the physiology of all organisms, compromising cellular function, reducing resistance to stress, and increasing the likelihood of developing age-related diseases. Characteristic conditions are late-onset neurodegenerative disorders and cognitive decline. Remarkably, while age is known to be a strong determinant of these conditions, the molecular mechanisms leading to natural age-related neural deterioration are virtually unknown. We propose a compelling approach to elucidate the mechanisms by which neurons age, how brain function is affected by aging and how, in turn, this is related to aging of the whole body. Through our research in a powerful genetic model organism we have uncovered, for the first time, the presence of genes that appear exclusively dedicated to protecting neurons and neuronal circuits from the effects of aging. These findings provide us with a unique entry point toelucidate the mechanisms of neuronal aging. We propose to use robust genetic aproaches in C. elegans, a model system with a strong track record of contributions to the field of aging and nervous system development and function, to tease apart the molecular mechanisms underlying normal age-dependent brain decline and neuropathological conditions manifested during senescence. We will achieve this by (1) establishing the progression of age-related changes in the nervous system and elucidating the role of the neuronal protection genes we have indentified during aging, (2) test the role of lifespan-determining pathways in neuronal aging, and (3) identifying new gene products that function to protect the nervous system from aging. Ultimately, we expect that this research will provide a much-needed paradigm-shifting strategy for the design of effective interventions to improve human life at old age and to ameliorate the consequences of neurodegenerative diseases and cognitive decline. 1  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: While mental decline and the onset of neurodegenerative diseases are strongly dependent on age, the mechanisms by which aging triggers these conditions is largely unknown. The goal of this project is to understand how brain cells age, how brain function is affected and how in turn this is related to aging of the whole body, with the major goal of uncovering strategies to counteract age-related brain decline. We predict that this research strategy will open up completely novel and powerful advances into our understanding of nervous system aging. Ultimately, these studies are expected to fully direct and speed up future research in mammalian systems, where genetic approaches to identify aging-related genes is still quite complicated. The proposed studies in C. elegans are expected to establish a strong foundation to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of neuronal aging, at the single- neuron, circuit, and circuit output (behavior) levels. We expect that our findings will foster the study of novel molecular mechanisms that control neuronal decline and its relationship to aging, which will dramatically enhance our understanding of the molecular codes used by neurons to actively protect neuronal function despite developmental, mechanical, and environmental challenges. We expect that our research will have fundamental implications for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases and the development of approaches to ameliorate the consequences of aging for cognition, thus improving the quality of human life at old age.\n",

      "Work in model organisms has revealed that a small number of signal transduction pathways, including the Wnt/b-catenin pathway, play key roles throughout development, as well as in tissue repair and stem cell homeostasis in adults. Interestingly, the composition of the Wnt/b-catenin pathway differs in distinct cellular contexts, depending on expression of unique modifiers of the signaling pathway, or expression of different isoforms of conserved pathway components. We and others have evidence (see Preliminary studies) that Wnt/b-catenin signaling is repressed in pluripotent human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) undergoing selfrenewal, and that signaling is active during differentiation into both early and later mesodermal cell lineages. We hypothesize that context-dependent modifiers of Wnt/b-catenin signaling play key roles in the self-renewal and differentiation of hESCs.  The initial goal of this proposal is to test the hypothesis that context-dependent modulators of Wnt/b-catenin signaling play key roles in regulating self-renewal and differentiation in hESCs. We believe that pursuit of this goal will reveal detailed mechanisms by which Wnt/beta-catenin signaling regulates self-renewal and specification of cell fate in hESCs.  Our second goal is to expand our investigation of the roles of signal transduction pathways in stem cells to include the Hedgehog, Notch, and TGFb pathways, using novel multiplexed fluorescent reporters to enable simultaneous monitoring of multiple pathways in live cells. We believe that the development of the technology to simultaneously visualize the state of activity of multiple signaling pathways in live cells will have numerous uses in studies of signaling pathways in normal and diseased tissues.\n",

      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Sleep is a highly conserved behavior that is required for proper health and cognition in all animals studied to date, yet a function for sleep has not been described. Drosophila melanogaster exhibits many of the hallmarks of mammalian sleep, including increased arousal threshold, consolidated immobility, and regulation by both circadian rhythm and a homeostatic drive. Although great strides have been made in recent years towards understanding the neural circuitry and molecular pathways that regulate circadian rhythm in Drosophila, the regulation of sleep by the homeostatic drive is poorly understood. In a recent screen for genes involved in regulating sleep behavior, we found that flies lacking a functional copy of the Rab GTPase, lightoid (ltd), sleep at least 200min per 24h less than background controls. In addition, work by others has suggested that (1) the expression of ltd is Clock-dependent, (2) the expression of ltd is sleep/wake-regulated, (3) ltd is required for proper long-term memory, and (4) ltd is a homologue of the human gene, Rab32, which functions to localize PKA, a known regulator of sleep. The goal of the proposed project is to better understand the mechanism by which ltd regulates sleep behavior by taking 3 approaches: (1) I will analyze 4 ltd alleles for several aspects of sleep behavior, including overall sleep duration, sleep bout length, number of sleep bouts, latency to sleep, sleep rebound after deprivation, and total life span. (2) I will analyze the regulation of ltd using a quantitative PCR approach to determine if ltd is regulated by circadian drive, the homeostatic sleep drive, or light. (3) To determine in which brain regions ltd is sufficient to perform its sleep-regulation role, I will perform a tissue-specific rescue experiment with several GAL4 drivers that drive expression in known sleep-regulating areas of brain. The work proposed here will provide a better understanding of how the new sleep gene, ltd, regulates sleep. Furthermore, based on its connections to the molecular clock, learning & memory, and PKA, the proposed investigation of ltd could provide a molecular link between these disparate aspects of sleep biology. Finally, this work will identify ltd as an excellent candidate to aid in the diagnosis of sleep disorders such as insomina and somnabalism, as well as a potential drug target to offer treatment. We are interested in the function and regulation of sleep. Currently, we use the fruitfly, an animal that has recently been shown to be an excellent model for sleep behavior, to help understand how neural circuits control sleep/wake behavior, as well as to identify new genes that could be used to identify and treat sleep disorders in humans.\n",

      "Objective Rationale:  Breast cancer is the most common type of cancer among women in the United States and is the second leading cause of cancer death among women.  While mortality rates are decreasing due to early detection and successful therapies, breast cancer deaths is still a staggering 40,000 per year, underscoring the continued need for more effective therapeutic strategies.  Research has shown that dysregulation of receptor tyrosine kinases plays a prominent role in breast cancer initiation, progression, and metastasis.  Data from our lab and others have demonstrated that epithelial cell differentiation, survival, and growth in ductal and secretory epithelium require the function of ErbB3 and ErbB4 neuregulin receptors.  Molecular analysis has revealed the existence of several clinical breast cancer subtypes, with the molecular phenotype potentially representing the cell type from which the breast cancer originated.  This application aims to address the hypothesis that neuregulin signaling drives luminal fate of breast epithelial cells and influences the therapeutic response of breast cancers.  My research will dissect the mechanisms by which neuregulin signaling contributes to luminal cell fate decisions in the untransformed breast, providing a platform to understand breast health.  These studies will also reveal fundamental signaling pathways that are critical for development and will uncover the earliest steps in the process of breast cancer, allowing us to begin to develop therapeutic strategies to prevent breast cancers.  Lastly, our research will be instrumental in understanding the protective role of parity against postmenopausal breast cancers and neuregulin signaling on anti-estrogen resistance of luminal cancers.Career Goals:  Since an early age, I have been interested in breast cancer research, and this interest was refined and developed in my undergraduate studies as I began to learn how molecular alterations can drive breast cancer.  Further, my commitment to breast cancer research is demonstrated by my decision to stay in the breast cancer research field as a postdoctoral fellow upon completion of my predoctoral thesis studying metastasis of breast cancer to the bone.  My career goal is to lead an independent translational breast cancer research program that will make a positive impact on breast cancer patient care, the breast cancer research community, and on future scientists through improved treatment strategies and effective preventive strategies.  I plan to gain tangible skills during the time of this application with mouse models of cancer and combining these studies with cell culture molecular approaches to determine how best to prevent and treat breast cancer.The proposed training plan will provide me with the opportunity to expand my research skills, particularly in the areas of mouse models of breast cancer and parity involvement in breast cancer.  My mentor, Dr. Cook, received training as a developmental biologist and thus approaches breast cancer research through trying to understand developmental events that contribute to breast cancer formation and how these can be targeted to prevent breast cancer.  We have recruited additional senior scientists, Dr. Carlos Arteaga and Dr. Al Reynolds, from Vanderbilt to serve on my mentoring committee and assist in my professional development and research focus during the time of this application.  Aside from meeting with this committee twice yearly, I will also present my work at multiple meetings and seminars supported by the Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center Breast Program as well as the National Cancer Institute/National Health Institutes-funded Breast Cancer SPORE (Specialized Program of Research Excellence).  Additionally, my primary mentor and Dr. Arteaga have joint lab meetings, giving me the opportunity to present my data more often at these weekly lab meetings.  My co-mentor, Dr. Arteaga, is the director of the Breast Cancer SPORE and a leader in translational breast cancer research.  Thus, his guidance will undoubtedly help expedite the findings from this proposal to improving treatment options for breast cancer patients.  Taken together, this training plan will ensure my training in translational breast cancer research and will provide me with essential tools to establish myself as an independent investigator.  Successful completion of the proposed work will place me in an excellent position to pursue an independent, extramurally funded career in breast cancer research.Application of Research:  This application aims to address the function of neuregulin signaling in the untransformd mammary gland as it leads to influencing breast cancer phenotypes.  Heterogeneity in breast cancer can often be traced back to epithelial lineages and precursor cells.  This project is designed to define how neuregulin signaling affects cell specification, growth, and maintenance of the mammary gland and how these physiological processes are commandeered during breast tumorigenesis, thus offering a better understanding for development of therapies to target neuregulin signaling.\n",

      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The care of patients with complex healthcare needs is often fragmented because they receive care from multiple providers across disparate care locations and because information related to this care is frequently not transmitted between providers or locations. Inadequate inter-provider communication and care coordination significantly lessen care quality and compromise patient safety. This three-year project seeks to improve outcomes, quality and coordination of care for patients with complex healthcare needs by facilitating the availability of information following three types of care transitions into the ambulatory care setting. Specifically, information regarding care transitions will be made available to patients, primary care practitioners and care managers following hospitalizations, emergency department (ED) encounters, and specialty clinic evaluations. This project will build upon a regional Health Information Exchange (HIE) network created to connect providers serving 42,000 Medicaid beneficiaries across traditional institutional boundaries from both rural and urban settings in a 6 county region in the Northern Piedmont of North Carolina. This network includes 25 ambulatory care practices, 3 federally qualified health centers, 4 rural health clinics, 3 urgent care facilities, 11 government agencies, 5 hospitals and 2 cross-disciplinary care-management teams. Within this HIE network, 4,608 patients with complex healthcare needs have been identified. For this project, a standards-based clinical decision support tool will be utilized in order to ensure that the proposed approach is generalizable, portable, and scalable, and routinely available claims and scheduling data will be used as the primary data source. This approach will support both traditional clinic-based models of care as well as new care models including population health management and the use of cross-disciplinary teams. Under Aim 1, the existing HIE network and decision support tool will be enhanced to enable detection of transitions in care and delivery of timely, patient-specific information regarding these care transitions to patients, primary care clinicians and multidisciplinary care management team members. Under Aim 2, the impact of the proposed approach will be evaluated in a randomized controlled trial involving approximately 4600 patients, 309 primary care clinicians, and 31 care management workers. Patients with complex healthcare needs will be randomly assigned by family unit to one of three groups: 1) information on care transitions sent to patients and their clinic-based caregivers; 2) information sent to patients, their clinic-based caregivers and their care managers; and 3) no information sent. The primary outcome measure will be the overall rate of ED utilization for each study group. Under Aim 3, the economic attractiveness of the proposed approach will be determined. Under Aim 4, the technology and results of this study will be disseminated through public media, publications and presentations. Information-augmented care transitions between sites should result in improved care coordination, higher quality of care, and more appropriate care.\n",

      "1133162, PikovThe ICNPD-2011 conference will bring together international investigators of all levels to Sidney, Australia in order to discuss recent research findings and to establish new collaborations in the new and exciting field of neural prosthetic devices. The conference will take place on November 26-27, 2011. It will be preceded by a series of online discussions by the organizing committee, resulting in the selection of several key innovation challenges in the field that will be addressed at the conference. This proposal aims to expand the participation of junior US researchers at the conference by subsidizing their travel costs. Intellectual MeritThe overall conference theme will be the technological and biological challenges in translating the neural prosthetics into clinic. There are multiple research groups worldwide involved in development and testing of neuroprosthetic implants for a variety of neurological disorders and similar difficulties often arise in selecting biocompatible encapsulation materials, in applying modern wireless communication technology, in better understanding of clinical and user needs, etc. Several discussion panels will be held at the conference to stimulate the interaction of participants in seeking the solutions for these prevailing challenges, rather than simply reporting on the progress from the laboratories. An additional emphasis of the conference will be upon identifying the areas of possible collaborations between the US and Australian scientists and finding the mechanisms for jump-starting these collaborations. There are multiple opportunities for the researchers to initiate productive collaborative projects in the development and testing of devices for the hearing and vision loss, muscle paralysis, Parkinson?s disease, epilepsy, and other neurological disorders. The conference described in this proposal is one that will bring together established investigators and early-career researchers just entering this field. To enable a focused exchange at the discussion panels during the two-day meeting, there will be a series of brainstorming online discussions preceding the conference.Broader ImpactThe conference can inform the NSF about new developments in the rapidly growing neural prosthetics field. A specific goal of the NSF that will be aided by the conference is the establishment of new programs which emphasize integration of neural technology research and medical device industry. The conference will provide a good opportunity to highlight best practices in this area and to bring lessons from this experience to the NSF initiatives. The conference participants will be selected to represent a broad spectrum of interested participants from academia, national laboratories, government, and industry. Recruitment of participants representing researchers at all stages in their careers from well established to new researchers just starting their career will be actively pursued. A special effort will be made to increase the representation of women and underrepresented minorities at the conference. The conference program, poster and talk abstracts will be posted on the conference website as well as on Frontiers Conferences, a premier online depository for the conference proceedings in theneuroscience-related fields (www.frontiersin.org/conferences), to serve as a practical educational tool. In addition, the selected short papers, submitted to the conference, will be peer-reviewed and published as a special issue of the open-access journal Frontiers in Neuroscience.\n",

      "--------------------\n",
      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Patients with insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM; Type 1 diabetes) display higher bone loss and increased risk for osteoporosis and related bone fractures. However, the mechanisms that underlie bone loss in IDDM are still not fully understood. It is well established that bone mass is maintained by bone remodeling, a process that involves formation of new bone by osteoblasts and osteocytes and resorption of existing bone by osteoclasts. Bone remodeling is regulated by mechanical stimuli imposed continuously to the skeleton by physical activity, and proper response of osteocytes/osteoblasts to mechanical loading is thus essential for maintenance of bone function and skeletal integrity. The main goal of this R01 application is to test the novel hypothesis that altered expression of components of bone mechanosensory and transduction systems is a central mechanism leading to bone cell dysfunction and higher bone loss in IDDM. For this we will use comprehensive in vitro studies with bone cell lines that will be uniquely combined with in vivo bone physiology and in situ bone tissue analysis on the Type 1 diabetic Akita mouse model. The proposed in vitro studies will provide mechanistic insights into effects of high glucose on bone cell detection and response to mechanical stimuli. The in vivo and ultimate in situ studies with control age- matched and Akita mice treated with or without insulin will determine the impact of diabetes and associated high glucose on bone formation in response to mechanical loading, and evaluate the contribution of altered bone mechanosignaling to the higher bone loss in diabetes. These studies will be directed by a new investigator who has a background in biomedical engineering and has begun a first faculty appointment in a Department of Orthopaedic Surgery. Studies will combine the broad expertise of junior and senior researchers in the areas of biomedical engineering, pharmacology, physiology and molecular biology, and state-of-the-art biochemical, live cell imaging, histomorphometric studies and non-invasive in vivo whole animal bone imaging. The proposed studies are not only expected to advance understanding of mechanisms underlying diabetic osteopenia, highlighting the deleterious effects of high glucose on bone mechanosensory/transduction systems, but will also bring awareness to the importance of an early and tight glycemic control to prevent and reverse bone loss in diabetes.\n",

      "--------------------\n",
      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Lung diseases, including lung cancer and chronic lung diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, together account for some 280,000 deaths annually (American Lung Association). Contributing to this mortality is the fact that remediation of all forms of lung disease is hampered by the limited ability of lung to regenerate. Hence, lung tissue that is damaged by degeneration or infection, or lung tissue that is surgically resected, is not functionally replaced in vivo. Currently, the only way to replace lung tissue is to perform lung transplantation, an expensive procedure that is achieves only a 10% survival at 10 years, and one that is hampered by a severe shortage of organs.  Over the past 3 years, we have worked to address some fundamental challenges in lung tissue engineering. In order to produce a lung scaffold that has suitable geometry and mechanics for lung regeneration, we have developed technologies to decellularize entire lung tissues. We have shown that these acellular lung matrices retain the gross mechanical properties of the original lung tissues, and provide outstanding support for the adhesion and growth of epithelial and vascular cells. We have developed a novel,  biomimetic  bioreactor that provides for long-term sterile lung culture, circulation of nutrient medium through the lung vascular compartment, and  breathing  of nutrient medium into the airway. As a cell source to repopulate the acellular lung matrix, we have utilized syngeneic neonatal rat lung cells, as these cells show significant potential for growth inside the developing lung. We have made substantial and exciting progress in this work, and have shown the feasibility of regenerating many characteristics of lung tissue, but there remain several important issues that must be studied and addressed before the functionality of such lung tissues can be tested in vivo. Most fundamentally, in order to exchange gas, the lung must comprise sufficient alveolar diffusional surface area, must be populated with functional and differentiated epithelial cell subsets at correct anatomic locations in the alveoli and elsewhere, and must be invested with a functional microvasculature that withstands physiological perfusion pressures and does not leak fluid into the alveolar compartment. In this proposal, we will study and refine the lung tissue engineering system in order to address each of these issues and advance the central mission of functional lung regeneration, which is the capacity for effective gas exchange. We hypothesize that the acellular lung matrix, when suitably re-populated with lung epithelium and vascular cells, will support the growth and differentiation of these cells and will produce a tissue that is effective for gas exchange, based upon in vitro measurements.

      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This proposal seeks to identify the exact step(s) of adenovirus (Ad) infection that is (are) responsible for the initiation of an anti-Ad acute inflammatory response upon systemic virus application. Over the last two decades numerous Ad-based vectors have been developed for gene therapy applications and many are currently being tested in clinical trials. Most recently, interest in Ad has further expanded due to its potential as a vector for vaccination against life threatening infectious agents such as anthrax. While natural infections with Ad are largely harmless to humans, intravenous Ad administration may result in a severe inflammatory response, which can lead to fatal outcomes. It is currently recognized that the initiation of this acute systemic inflammation depends on interactions of the Ad capsid with host cells. Despite significant knowledge regarding Ad interactions with cells in vitro, the molecular mechanisms governing Ad bio-distribution, hepatic tropism and toxicity in vivo remain poorly understood. Recently, we identified a novel blood factor-dependent pathway of Ad liver cell infection in vivo. This finding explained the observed Ad biodistribution in animals after systemic application and is fundamental for the development of novel strategies to modify both Ad tropism in vivo and virus-associated toxicity. In mouse models, we will analyze the innate immune response to intravenously applied capsid-modified Ad mutants deficient in their ability to undergo the initial steps of virus infection. Our specific aims are to analyze the role of Ad interactions 1) with primary attachment receptors; 2) with integrins, which facilitate Ad initialization; or 3) with cellular factors upon virus escape from endosomes, in the initiation of an anti-Ad inflammatory response. Based on the data obtained, in our fourth specific aim we will construct ah Ad vector ablated for binding to known virus receptors and capable of infecting cells via an alternative receptor, LDLR. By applying this vector in mice and evaluating its toxicity we will test the hypothesis that modification of the Ad capsid represents a feasible approach to reduce acute Ad-mediated inflammation while preserving virus gene transfer ability upon systemic application. These studies will significantly improve our understanding of fundamental mechanisms of the host defense against viral pathogens and may ultimately lead to the development of safe and efficient Ad vectors for the therapy of a wide range of inborn and acquired human diseases.\n",

      "gene expression chromatin transcription epigenetic regulation histone regulatory transcriptional methylation\n",
      "--------------------\n",
      "ï»¿   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    The regulation of gene expression dictates when, where, and to what degree protein isoforms are generated, thereby meeting the metabolic needs of various cell types that make up organs and living beings. Given the constantly changing microenvironment, this process is highly dynamic, capable of adjusting instantly to multiple external cues, or mounting gene expression responses within extended periods of time. To achieve diverse gene expression responses cells rely on multiple points of regulation that include modulating the origin and rate of transcription,altering pre-mRNA processing to induce the generation of alternatively spliced mRNA isoforms, changing the length or location of the 3' UTR through alternative polyadenylation, selective mRNA isoform translation, and altering the stability of mRNA pools. All of these gene expression steps are integrated and co-dependent. However, our understanding of the dynamic nature of gene expression is limited because most cell-based investigations analyze only steady-state levels of gene expression and because detailed analyses focus only on one of the multiple steps involved in representing a gene expression profile. This research application focuses on evaluating the dynamics of gene expression from pre-mRNA generation through RNA processing in the nucleus to translation and mRNA degradation in the cytoplasm with the long-term goal to chart the life span of all expressed mRNAs upon cellular transformation. We will test the hypothesis that alterations in the kinetics of gene expression steps set in stone unique gene expression programs that dictate cellular fate. Using novel metabolic labeling techniques we will track pre-mRNA dynamics in the nucleus (Aim 1) and mRNA dynamics in the cytoplasm (Aim 2) to develop a comprehensive understanding on the kinetic interplay that establishes steady-state gene expression patterns. Aim 3 will use this understanding and tools to determine to what degree alterations in the dynamics of gene expression steps contribute to the overall change in gene expression profiles that accompany Src-induced breast epithelial cell transformation. The experiments described will highlight how crucial the interplay between transcription, RNA processing and mRNA translation is for the development of altered gene expression programs. Furthermore, understanding the kinetics involved in establishing novel gene expression profiles may pave the way for novel therapies of human breast cancer. Throughout this project we will rely on our expertise in kinetics, RNA biology and bioinformatics to obtain complete kinetic profiles of gene expression unique to Src-induced breast epithelial cell transformation, thus producing a wealth of data useful to the gene expression and breast cancer research communities. The identification of breast cancer-specific gene expression events may be valuable for the development of novel early detection or prediction tools.\n",

      "Published reports on software-development costs and our interactions with many companies reveal that testing and debugging consume too much of the development costs. Furthermore, the ubiquitous nature of software requires that it be high quality. Thus, there is an urgent need for technology that companies can use to improve the process to reduce the cost of these activities and improve the quality of the software. The technology that this team will explore for commercialization consists of rigorous techniques that are highly automated, and have the potential to improve reliability and adaptability of today's large, complex software systems at a reduced cost. These techniques have provided the foundations in testing and debugging on which many additional techniques have been developed. The techniques have been implemented in prototype tools that have been used for experimentation that shows their effectiveness and efficiency in improving the quality of the software and reducing the cost of achieving it. However, no commercial tools or systems currently provide this advanced technology. The team's project has the potential to provide such tools and systems. The technology the team plans to commercialize will improve the efficiency and effectiveness of software development by addressing the process of testing and debugging. Not only will the technology result in higher-quality software for those companies who use it, but it will provide savings in the costs of the software development. Because the technology can be used for testing and debugging at all levels of development (e.g., individual, team, and system), on systems written in different programming languages and on non-code components (e.g., databases), by companies that develop software for their own use or to sell, and by companies of all sizes, the commercialization of the technology can have a significant impact on industry. If successful in commercializing the technology, the tools and systems being built will ultimately improve software quality and, thus, has the potential to have a significant societal benefit. The project will prepare students and faculty who participate in the important area of entrepreneurship, which will help them transition the technology developed to industry.\n",

      "ï»¿   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Prostate cancer is a heterogeneous disease with significant variations in its clinical outcome. Current methods to assess prostate cancer risk combine prostate specific antigen (PSA) screening and random prostate biopsy. Unfortunately, this strategy fails to reveal the lesion's location and does not accurately differentiate between aggressive and non-aggressive prostate cancers. As a result, most patients will receive unnecessary active treatment for low-risk prostate cancer in order to avoid under treatment. Active treatment involves surgery or radiation, often causing long-term side effects such as urinary incontinence, erectile dysfunction, or bowel urgency. Therefore, non-invasive and accurate diagnostic methods to determine the location of prostate cancer and to assess its immediate risk are needed.  The mission of Prostate Theranostics is to address this problem by developing targeting MRI contrast enhancing agents specific to an extracellular matrix (ECM) protein, oncofetal fibronectin (onfFN), for early accurate detection of prostate cancer. These agents would also be fitted with Gd(III)-chelates that would allow their location to be visualized within men's prostates using MRI. MRI is a non-invasive clinical diagnostic technique and can provide three-dimensional images of whole prostate with a resolution as high as 100 Âµm. Recent studies show that the over expression of extracellular matrix proteins within prostate tissue are correlated to prostate cancer aggressiveness. In addition, these proteins can be targeted using specific peptide sequences. This project proposes to develop MRI contrast-enhancing agents with specific peptide sequences. These targeting probes would then bind to aggressive prostate cancer after intravenous injection. In addition, the clinician would be able tovisualize location of human prostate cancer using MRI.  The objectives of this SBIR Phase I project are to further optimize the targeted contrast-enhancing agent and commercialize the agent for clinical imaging prostate cancer. Non-invasive accurate detection of prostate cancer is an unmet clinical need for prostate cancer management. Successful development of our imaging technology has the potential to accurately detect and diagnose prostate cancer, replace invasive prostate biopsy, and improve decision-making in clinical management of prostate cancer. It also has the potential for non-invasive active surveillance of prostate cancer and timely monitoring of disease progression, as well as image-guided surgery and therapy.\n",

      "The study of human immunology is often difficult because certain types of experiments can't be performed on humans for obvious ethical reasons. To facilitate human research, many scientists utilize animal models. The animal model of choice for immunologists is the mouse. This animal model is very useful because of the large number of reagents available as well as the creation of transgenic and knockout mice. Both types of mice are required for this program project grant. Transgenic carrying  humanized  MHC molecules will be iused to discover new epitopes for influenza proteins in project 2 and in project 3, they will be used to model human influenza infection in mice. Knockout mice are required so that the mouse endogenous MHC class Ior II genes are not expressed in the MHC transgenic mice. Two projects will require some of thesame strains of mice and procedures, so for continuity between the projects an animal core providing the necessary services is required.

      "smoking nicotine tobacco cessation smokers quit cigarette cigarettes smoke abstinence\n",
      "--------------------\n",
      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Prior research indicates that smokers who metabolize nicotine more rapidly have lower quit rates in response to smoking cessation therapy. The rate of nicotine metabolism is one of the most robust predictors of abstinence. The overall goal of this proposal is to elucidate the as yet unknown mechanisms by which the rate of nicotine metabolism influences tobacco dependence. This could have important implications for understanding how particular smoking cessation medications work and in selecting the best medication for a particular smoker. Our studies will use the nicotine metabolite ratio (NMR) (the ratio between the nicotine metabolites 3'hydroxycotinine and cotinine, a test that was developed and validated by our laboratory) as a simple and clinically feasible biomarker for the rate of nicotine metabolism. We hypothesize that a faster rate of metabolism leads to faster elimination of nicotine from the body and a more rapid dissipation of brain tolerance to nicotine in the interval between cigarettes, leading in turn to (1) more severe nicotine withdrawal symptoms and (2) greater subjective reward from the cigarette smoked following deprivation. These effects would help to explain why smokers with faster rates of nicotine metabolism have a poorer response to smoking cessation therapy when compared to those with slower rates of metabolism. We will explore the relationship of the NMR to the endophenotypes of withdrawal, craving and reward, with the assumption that these factors are likely intermediaries for the mechanism linking nicotine metabolism to tobacco dependence and smoking cessation rates with pharmacotherapy. Our study design uses a brief (6 hour) interval of smoking abstinence followed by a  reward  cigarette to elicit the subjective responses relating to withdrawal and reward. Because smoking behavior and severity of nicotine dependence vary by race and sex we will also compare the relationship between NMR and withdrawal and reward in African American vs. white smokers and in men vs. women. Secondary analyses will examine whether nicotine half-life mediates the observed effects of NMR on primary response measures [additional aim relating to CYP2A6 genotyping has been eliminated].  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Nicotine dependence remains one of the major underlying causes of premature death and disability in our society. While the introduction of smoking cessation medications has increased quitting rates, absolute quit rates remain disappointingly low. The rate of nicotine metabolism, as assessed by the nicotine metabolite ratio (NMR) has been found in preliminary studies to be a robust predictor of smoking cessation in response to some types of medications. The mechanism by which the NMR predicts smoking cessation is not known, but could have important implications for understanding how particular smoking cessation medications work and in selecting the best medication for a particular smoker. The research described in this proposal will help elucidate the mechanisms by which the NMR is associated with nicotine dependence and the likelihood of quitting smoking, and may contribute to the development of personalized treatment strategies for smokers who want to quit.\n",

      "Forest ecosystems in the northeastern U.S. provide many important water resource benefits to people living in the region, including high quality drinking water, a reliable supply of water year-round, and protection against flooding. We know that past fluctuations in climate and land use have caused important changes to the species composition and structure of these forests. However, scientists predict that climate change processes currently underway due to human activity will likely result in an even greater frequency and intensity of extreme climate events than experienced in the past, especially more severe droughts, flooding, and temperature extremes. We currently know very little about how such changes in climate conditions will impact the northeastern forests and the critical water resources they provide to local populations. For example, climate change may significantly alter the water cycle by influencing how much water trees use or by changing the species composition of forests. The primary objective of this project is to understand how different forest species in New Hampshire will respond to climate change in terms of their water use and impacts on water supply and water quality. Specifically, we will measure water use by three different species considered to be particularly sensitive to climate change: American Beech, Sugar Maple, and Yellow Birch, over the period of several years at several sites located in the White Mountains of New Hampshire. The results will be incorporated into models in order to make predictions of how these species will likely respond to future changes in climate in terms of their water use and impacts on the amount and timing of streamflow. This information can be used by local water resource managers to make more informed decisions about how to best manage forests for sustainable provisioning of hydrologic services such as reliable and clean water and flood mitigation. The results of this study will also be valuable to the public because it will help people understand how and why the forests are responding to climate change, and therefore allow them to participate more actively in the development and implementation of effective policies to enhance the capacity of communities in the region to adapt to, and mitigate the effects of, climate change impacts on forests and water.\n",

      "G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) play critical roles in biologically and medically important signaling; however, the molecular mechanisms of activation of intracellular G proteins by ligand-bound GPCRs are not understood. The yeast pheromone response pathway provides an example of GPCR signaling that can be genetically manipulated in ways that would be impossible in other types of cells, yet components of this pathway are functionally interchangeable with corresponding components of mammalian systems. This project will use genetic approaches only possible in yeast to pursue a step-by-step dissection of the mechanisms of GPCR signaling by heterologously expressed somatostatin type 2 receptor and the endogenous yeast receptor for the a-mating pheromone, two receptors that can activate the same G protein but share no sequence similarity. The aims of the project are: I. Identification of sites of G protein interaction with receptors. To address the question of how activation of a GPCR leads to nucleotide exchange by a G protein and to map the interfaces between the two types of receptors and G proteins, a genetic screen will be conducted to identify mutations in G protein subunits that specifically prevent the interaction with receptors and mutations in receptors that specifically compensate for defects in G protein subunits. II. Identification of the conformational changes that constitute receptor activation. A new technique for pair-wise random introduction of cysteine residues will be used to screen for mutant receptor alleles that are locked in the activated state by disulfide bonds as a way of identifying sites that undergo intramolecular motion upon activation of receptors. III. Identification of ligand-receptor interactions mediating responses to different types of ligands. Screens will be conducted to identify mutant somatostatin receptors with altered responses to certain ligands and altered somatostatin ligands with altered effects on signaling. The goal is to identify particular sites of ligand-receptor interaction that are specific for activated and un-activated states of the receptor. IV. Determination of effects of receptor oligomerization on signaling and identification of sites of receptor-receptor interaction. A new flow cytometry-based assay will be used to screen libraries of randomly mutagenized receptors to identify amino acid substitutions that specifically block receptor oligomerization. The mutant receptors will then be used to determine the effects of oligomerization on signaling function.\n",

      "Obesity is one of the most serious health problems in the United States affecting about 33% of adult Americans 20-74 years old. Morbidity and mortality increases significantly with increasing weight, especially with abdominal obesity. The increased morbidity and mortality results primarily from increased incidence of cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension, stroke and coronary artery disease. Obesity is also associated with abnormal insulin levels, diabetes mellitus, and lipid abnormalities. However there is very limited information about the possible mechanisms by which obesity may lead to increased risk for cardiovascular diseases. A more thorough understanding of physiological relationship between overweight and cardiovascular disease would be facilitated by identification of an appropriate experimental model exhibiting important characteristics associated with human obesity and yet suitable for study of cardiovascular function. We hypothesize that diet-induced obesity in rats produced by feeding a high fat diet will exhibit characteristics of human obesity including hypertension and biomarkers of cardiovascular disease. This research is aimed to obtain baseline data for developing research examining the role dietary fat in regulation of blood pressure, lipid metabolism and biomarkers of cardiovascular disease in obesity. Obesity will be induced by feeding a high-fat, high-Calorie diet in rats. This model of obesity is similar to that which occurs in human consuming high-Calorie, high-fat diets. Rats that become obese are those gaining at least 20% more weight (DIO) than the average weight gain of the entire group. Rats that are resistant to developing obesity are those gaining at least 20% less weight (DR) than the average weight gain. Three different diets containing normal level of fat, high level of fat from beef tallow or high level of fat from fish oil will be fed to DIO and DR rats for 10 weeks. Blood pressure, blood and tissue lipid profile and blood levels of insulin, cardiovascular disease biomarker, CRP and obesity-associated hormone, leptin will be measured. The information generated from this study will be used for education of public for prevention of obesity associated cardiovascular health problems and increase of consumer awareness about dietary fat and health.\n",

      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): All organisms must protect their internal system from cellular stress. Whether stress arises from external toxins or mutation and disease, cells must sensitively monitor stress signals and mount the appropriate responses to maintain internal homeostasis. Despite the importance of stress defense, much remains unknown about the mechanisms eukaryotes use to survive stressful situations. Functional genomics has uncovered functions for many genes in various genomes, largely by characterizing gene function under standard conditions. However, a substantial fraction of genes remains uncharacterized, and many of these are likely to be involved in stress defense and thus have not been uncovered through traditional studies. This proposal will use high-throughput functional genomics, genomic expression analysis, computational biology, and techniques in genetics and biochemistry to identify and characterize genes involved in stress defense in yeast. Aim 1 will exploit two new phenotypes related to stress defense to uncover novel genes involved in eukaryotic stress survival. The first is a phenomenon known as `acquired stress resistance', in which cells exposed to a small dose of one stress become resistant to an otherwise lethal dose of a different stress. The second is a phenomenon in which cells retain a `memory' of stress resistance that persists for many generations after mild-stress treatment, even after the mild stress has been removed. We will use these phenotypes in high-throughput selections to identify yeast deletion mutants that cannot acquire or retain resistance to severe stress after mild-stress treatment. Identified genes, as well as known regulators of acquired stress resistance, will be characterized to define their precise roles in these phenomena. Cells respond to stress with a multi-facetted response. This response, including reorganization of genomic expression, is coordinated by a complex signaling network that responds to stress. Aim 2 will elucidate the intricate stress-activated signaling network in yeast that orchestrates genomic expression responses to stress. Regulators of stress-dependent genes will be identified by screening the yeast-deletion library for mutants unable to induce expression upon stress treatments. Identified regulators and various known network components will be organized into a putative signaling network, using numerous computational approaches. This network will be subsequently dissected and refined based on genomic, genetic, and biochemical studies. These experiments will help to elucidate the complex stress-activated signaling network in yeast, which serves as an excellent model for such networks in humans and other organisms, while developing computational approaches that are likely to advance this area of biology. As many of these responses are conserved in humans, these results will foster stress minimization and disease prevention in human medicine.     Project Relevance: Many stress-defense mechanisms used by yeast are conserved in humans, and therefore the results of this proposal will provide a strong foundation for understanding, and eventually modulating, stress resistance for human health. These results will have broad application, from minimizing debilitating side effects of chemotherapy, to reducing trauma inflicted by invasive surgery, heart attacks and strokes, to preventing cancer. Furthermore, understanding how yeast sense and respond to stress is an excellent model for how human cells respond to analogous cellular stresses.\n",

      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Project Summary/Abstract Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a significant problem for HIV-infected patients, yet the extent to which the newest CVD risk prediction tools accurately predict risk for HIV patients is not known. In this grant, we willevaluate the new American College of Cardiology (ACC)/ American Heart Association (AHA) CVD risk prediction algorithm, released in November 2013, to assess its performance in HIV patients. We will then develop a new risk prediction algorithm incorporating HIV and HIV-related factors to attempt to improve risk prediction. The rationale for performing this study is the uniqu pathophysiology underlying HIV-associated CVD, which is thought to be incompletely explained by traditional risk factors and driven in large part by inflammation and immune dysregulation. While established CVD risk prediction tools have been applied to HIV groups, there is not evidence that they are appropriate for use as they do not reflect these underlying immunologic and inflammatory changes. Accurate prediction of CVD risk is particularly important as it is a key component of the newly released 2013 cholesterol guidelines, which guide clinicians in identifying patients in need of CVD risk modifying treatment. Through Aim 1 of the proposed study, we will evaluate the new ACC/AHA CVD risk prediction algorithm, assessing the degree to which it accurately predicts CVD risk for HIV patients and hypothesizing that it will under predict risk. We will conduct a parallel analysis of the longstanding Framingham Risk Score. In Aim 2, we will develop a new CVD risk prediction algorithm tailored for use in HIV populations, for the first time incorporating HIV status as a CVD risk factor within a prediction function and hypothesizing that its inclusion will improve risk prediction beyond that by traditional CVD risk factors alone. We will refine this analysis by assessing whether inclusion of HIV-related variables indicating disease and treatment status further improve risk prediction beyond inclusion of HIV status alone. To achieve these aims, we will leverage an established cohort uniquely suited to perform the study to be conducted by a cross- disciplinary team assembled with specific expertise in the relevant fields. We will collaborate with Dr. Ralph D'Agostino and his team, who have decades of experience in risk prediction statistical analysis, to apply sophisticated risk prediction methodology in order to rigorously compare established and new risk prediction functions. Cardiovascular risk prediction is a critical aspect of HIV-related heartdisease as it underlies a clinician's ability to identify high-risk individuals in need of risk-modifying therapy. Validating the new ACC/AHA risk prediction algorithm in diverse settings and assessing the benefit of novel risk markers were specific priorities identified in the new 2013 ACC/AHA risk assessment guidelines, both of which will be performed through this study. The proposed study presents an opportunity to answer a timely question with a significant clinical and public health impact, optimizing methods for CVD risk prediction in HIV and thereby improving CVD preventative strategies for this at-risk group.\n",

Addressing and understanding these differences is critical for evaluating the factors involved and for improving health status and quality of life. Research approaches to address this goal will range from the molecular to the clinical level. Toward this end, the RCMI Program proposes to: (1) develop infrastructure and provide support services to facilitate the conduct of multidisciplinary collaborative research in health disparities; (2) target specific areas of research and provide initial funding for developing these research activities; (3) promote the professional development of junior research faculty working on this area.     The program will have three components: a Division of Research Resources, which will include infrastructure activities that provide research support services. These service activities will include, among others: the RCMI Proteomics Discovery Core Facility; the Center for Molecular Genetics and Infectious Diseases Research, the Enhancement of Neurogenetics Research at the Institute of Neurobiology, and the Collaborative Technologies Initiative for which funding is requested. The Division of Research Development will help achieve the second objective, by providing a focal point for research activities conducted by junior investigators. Two pilot projects in the area of infectious diseases were identified for development. The third objective, professional development of promising research faculty, will be approached through a series of activities including a mentoring program designed to foster the research career development. The Division of Advancement in Research will oversee the mentoring program and will offer a course for strengthening research skills, will provide scientific editing services, will train on how to protect and commercializing ideas, and will develop a comprehensive multidisciplinary collaborative research seminar series. Many of these activities will be offered utilizing the information technology infrastructure developed by the Center for Information Architecture in Research during the current cycle.\n",

The liver's extraordinary regenerative capacity is critical to understanding the mechanisms leading to developmental defects, acute and chronic liver diseases, and liver carcinogenesis. Stimulation of hepatocyte proliferation while preventing apoptosis is essential to the liver's regenerative process. Recently we uncovered a tumor suppressor pathway has potent effects upon liver cell division and death. Our long range goal is to define the cellular mechanisms underlying liver regeneration in health and disease and to apply these findings to developing improved therapies for liver disease. To that end, we are uniquely capable to address the objectives of this application, which are to uncover the mechanism that leads to the novel tumor suppressors' profound effects upon the liver. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that: The tumor suppressor controls liver celgrowth factor pathway in controlling liver size. At the end of the study we will better understand the growth and death of liver cells. This will help develop treatment for many liver diseases such as liver transplantation, cirrhosis, acute and chronic hepatitis.\n",

Development, Function and Repair of the Muscle Cell Project Summary: This application requests partial support to conduct the international meeting,  Development, Function and Repair of the Muscle Cell . This meeting is part of the  Frontiers in Myogenesis  series, which is sponsored by the Society for Muscle Biology. This conference series has been held triennially for more than 20 years. This specific meeting will be held June 4-8, 2012 on the campus of New York University at the Kimmel Center in Manhattan, New York. We expect approximately 350 participants from around the world. The  Development, Function and Repair of the Muscle Cell  conference is timely and significant for three reasons: 1) the studies of embryonic and adult myogenesis and muscle development and regeneration are seeing a rich convergence in genes and mechanisms. This conference will serve as a platform to highlight key similarities in these processes with a view tothe understanding of muscle disease; 2) the emerging areas in the regulation of muscle development include nuclear organization and chromatin remodeling during muscle specification and differentiation, RNA regulation, cell-cell fusion, muscle cell architecture including nuclear and mitochondrial positioning, muscle cell interactions with nerve and tendon cells, and muscle stem cell activation and use for repair. This meeting will focus and discuss these areas with leading experts from around the world; and (3) this meeting is placing a unique emphasis upon inviting key investigators on the cutting edge of cell biological research outside, but complementary, to the muscle field. The goal is to stimulate cross-disciplinary collaborations for the muscle field to address issues in the field that are emerging and promise to advance the field. The overall objective of this meeting is to bring together experts in developmental, cellula and molecular biology, adult muscle biology, human genetics and translational research significant for muscle disease to stimulate research and foster new collaborations at both the basic and translational levels. In addition, we will focus on recent advances in the regulatory mechanisms in muscle specification, muscle differentiation, muscle regeneration, muscle stem cell biology and emphasize how these advances inform potential therapies for muscle disease. Seven plenary sessions presenting 62 speakers (20 to be selected from submitted abstracts) at the senior, mid-career and junior levels will address: Origins, Patterning and Behaviors of Muscle Progenitors; Transcriptional Control of Myogenesis and Muscle Progenitors' Identity; Muscle Differentiation; Interaction of Muscle Cells with its Environment; Adult Muscle Progenitors, Satellite cells: Specification and Contribution to Muscle Repair; Muscle Size Regulation; and Therapeutic Interventions to Human Muscle Disease. Three dedicated poster sessions that feature these and related topics will be held. Significantly, the participants of thi conference represent interdisciplinary groups that will afford a comprehensive analysis and integration of recent discoveries in the field. In addition, the conference will promote cross-fertilization of ideas and collaborative interactions, particularly from scientists working on the leading edge of cell biology. We expect that the major advances in muscle development, muscle cell biology, gene regulation, muscle stem cells and regeneration and muscle disease that have taken place since the previous  Frontiers in Myogenesis  conference will make this upcoming meeting in New York an essential gathering for investigators across these areas of muscle biology.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Baylies, Mary K. Development, Function and Repair of the Muscle Cell Project Narrative This conference will provide a novel platform for the interaction of experts and trainees in genetics, molecular, cellular and developmental biology of muscle and in translational research significant to muscle disease. The meeting will place additional importance upon inviting key investigators on the cutting edge of cell biological research outside, but complementary, to the muscle field. The goal is to stimulate cross-disciplinary collaborations for the muscle field to address issues in the field that are emerging and promise to advance the field. The meeting will promote discussion and dissemination of recently published and unpublished data pertinent to the cellular and molecular regulation of muscle development and homeostasis in the embryo and the adult; how these processes go awry in muscle disease and how knowledge of normal muscle formation and homeostasis may be exploited in muscle disease therapies.\n",

      "This proposal aims to improve the retention of graduate students in the first two years and increase the number of students going to graduate school.  We do this by incorporating students in research and the mathematical community earlier and providing support programs for pre-graduate students. The main component is a set of interconnected summer programs involving research experiences and short courses for students.  These are designed to engage them and encourage them to continue in mathematics. Several parts of this proposal are directly aimed at underrepresented students. The major programs include the following. (1) Research for Early Graduate Students (REG), designed to sustain the enthusiasm for collaborative original research that attracts students to Ph.D. programs by providing them with research experiences during the early years of graduate work. (2) Research and enrichment experiences for under-represented undergraduate students (REU+), designed to provide a supportive REU experience for underrepresented students who may not usually consider an REU program. An important feature is the inclusion of established mentors of underrepresented students to work with the program and us. (3) Enhanced Research Program for Early Graduates (REG+), a one-year program for students who have graduated from college and are not quite prepared for graduate studies in mathematics. This program targets underrepresented groups. The program includes a summer research experience, a year of remedial course work and significant mentoring.  Four important groups are included: underrepresented undergraduate students, post-baccalaureate students considering returning to mathematics, under-prepared graduate students, and early graduate students. In particular, this grant features a collaborative effort between faculty at NCSU, and the Mathematics Departments of 6 Historically Black Colleges and Universities. We aim to increase the number of underrepresented students who get graduate degrees in Mathematics.\n",

      "PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions): Clinical Trials Office The Clinical Trials Office (CTO) provides a centralized service to support the development and execution of clinical trials in all of the Center's defined Research Programs. The CTO oversees all trials from a variety of venues and sponsors, including pharmaceutical, local institutional trials, and cooperative group trials. It has oversight of trials from a diverse group of medical specialties including, but not limited to, medical oncology, radiation oncology, surgery, hematology oncology, gynecologic oncology, palliative care, supportive care, and basic science. This includes protocol preparation, data acquisition, safety monitoring and reporting, quality assurance, regulatory compliance, overall study management and personnel training. The CTO serves the overall clinical research needs of investigators in protocol development and activation, and its staff is integral to the clinical care provided throughout the clinical trial continuum. The CTO is intentionally structured to operate with efficiency, to focus on the quality of clinical data collected, and to facilitate timely activation of and accrual to therapeutic trials. Sustained success has been demonstrated in all 3 categories. Targeted efforts are ongoing in order to reduce the number of low accruing clinical trials and to increase the number of investigator-initiated therapeutic clinical trials and accrual to those trials. Since the last review, considerable efforts have been made to centralize clinical and protocol data management activities by integrating the hematologic malignancies within the clinical trials office. The clinical trials office is currently implementing a new clinical trial management system (Velos) in collaboration with the Clinical Translational Research Institute (CTRI) (the CTRI leverages CTSA grant support), which will provide more robust protocol management and patient accrual reporting capabilities. Additionally, a protocol development manager and regulatory specialist have been recruited to assist with the conduct of the center's investigator-initiated trials. An important focus for new trials will be molecular profiling and individualization of therapy, which will be implemented within clinical trials with CTO staff support.\n",

      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Abuse of cocaine is a widespread and severely deleterious public health problem. Although it is well established that there is substantial variability in an individual's response to cocaine exposure, we do not yet understand the mechanisms that mediate individual differences in the etiology of cocaine abuse and addiction. In particular, we do not understand why some individuals are resistant to the effects of cocaine and will consume cocaine at low rates whereas other individuals are relatively vulnerable to the effects of cocaine and will consume cocaine at high rates. In the present proposal, we will evaluate several novel biomarkers that may predict the vulnerability of an individual to abuse cocaine or to relapse following abstinence. We will evaluate these processes using drug self-administration (SA) and reinstatement of previously drug-maintained behavior in nonhuman primates, as these are well established animal models of cocaine abuse and relapse. Moreover, we propose to determine, in a highly systematic manner, whether the availability of specific brain proteins, the acute brain activational effects of cocaine, or the integrity of functional bran networks predicts cocaine abuse and relapse. We believe that these studies will have important public health implications because these techniques can be translated into use in human subjects, and they will allow physicians to individually tailor treatment plans based on the current status of the cocaine-dependent patient.\n",

      "genetic variants genome variation sequencing genomic genetics disease association traits\n",
      "--------------------\n",
      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The ability to generate sequence data is rapidly becoming a reality. Sequencing efforts are already underway at candidate gene regions surrounding association peaks identified by genome-wide association studies (GWAS), paving the way for  whole-exome  and, ultimately, whole-genome sequencing studies. Comprehensive sequencing has the potential to reveal a vast trove of low frequency variants, but most statistical association methods used for GWAS are likely inadequate because they are targeted towards common variants and have been optimized for identifying associations at a single variant at a time, and therefore, do not account for multiple variants acting at the same locus. For sequencing studies to attain their full potential, the development of new statistical methods will be critical. We propose to develop new methods for both targeted and genome-wide sequencing approaches. In Specific Aim 1 we will develop statistical methods for identifying causal variants inside a targeted region, such as a GWAS peak or candidate gene. DNA sequencing provides a complete picture of genetic variation, enabling the localization of association signal(s) in order to identify true causal alleles against a background of correlated variants due to linkage disequilibrium. We will design statistical strategies for finding causal variants underlying association peaks. We will consider the presence of multiple causal alleles at a locus. In Specific Aim 2 we will develop statistical methods for sequencing studies to optimally capture the association signal arising from multiple rare variants acting within the same disease gene. The initial focus will be on candidate gene sequencing with an eye towards whole-exome and even whole-genome sequencing. Associations of individual rare alleles with disease are difficult to detect because low-frequency alleles have limited power in single-variant association tests. We will develop methods combining multiple rare variants from the same gene (or pathway) and treat genes (pathways) rather than individual alleles as the unit for the association test. Recent studies demonstrate that genes underlying certain quantitative phenotypes display an excess of rare coding variation in individuals at one phenotypic extreme. In addition to combining multiple rare variants in a single test, we will also develop methods incorporating both rare and common variants, which will be important when whole- genome sequencing eventually becomes practical. In Specific Aim 3 we will assess the power of both targeted and genome-wide approaches and generate study design recommendations, using a population genetic model based on allele frequency distributions from empirical sequencing data sets. We will make recommendations on sequencing strategies, sample sizes, and inclusion of specific populations. All power calculations and recommendations will critically depend on assumptions about allele frequency distributions, which we will rigorously model using empirical sequence data. Our population genetic model will incorporate complex demographic histories, recombination and natural selection in addition to mutation and genetic drift.   RESEARCH NARRATIVE:  The study of human genetic variation has already begun to pay big dividends, as genome- wide association studies (GWAS) focusing on common genetic variation has identified risk variants for numerous complex diseases. However, for most diseases the fraction of genetic heritability explained by these findings is extremely small, motivating deep resequencing studies, which will be able to identify rare risk variants. These resequencing studies will require new statistical methods that will have great potential for furthering our understanding of disease etiology, leading to possible drug targets, and may also be useful for diagnostic testing in healthy individuals.\n",

      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dysfunction of the vascular endothelium contributes to most cardiovascular, circulatory, and blood diseases. This is not surprising, as the endothelium is the central regulator of hemostasis, vascular development, angiogenesis, vasomotor tone, and the response to vascular injury and inflammation. We have used several complementary approaches during the past funding cycle  taking advantage of our longstanding interest in endothelial cell differentiation and gene expression programs   to fill in the gaps in our understanding of how endothelial cell destiny and phenotypic diversity are determined. Some of our most exciting findings during the previous funding cycle came from the results of using global gene expression analysis of differentiating endothelial cells to identify candidate genes that are responsible for vascular development. Through this approach, we established a comprehensive list of candidate genes associated with the development of the vascular system during embryonic stem cell differentiation in vivo. Many of the genes we identified in this study were predictable: growth factors, cell surface markers, transcription factors and members of several signal transduction pathways already known to be associated with vasculogenesis. However, we also discovered some new players, including members of the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) and Wnt signaling pathways. In addition, we identified and cloned the novel endothelial cell precursor-derived protein called BMPER, which has become a major focus of the Specific Aims proposed for our next funding cycle. In this funding cycle, we will explore in more detail the molecular roles of these proteins in modulating endothelial cell phenotypes, with a focus on BMP signaling pathways in the vasculature. The aims of the proposal are to (1) understand the diversity of molecular effects of BMPER in endothelial cells; (2) characterize the diversity of cellular effects of BMPER in endothelial cells; and (3) delineate the role of BMPER in regulation of vascular angiogenic signaling events and inflammation. The scope of this proposal is intended to address relevant biological and physiological questions using state of the art molecular biology techniques. Knowledge gained from this proposal should provide crucial information about endothelial cell development from multipotent precursors, blood vessel formation in health and disease, and endothelial cell-type specific gene expression. In addition, mechanisms for targeted gene delivery to endothelial cells and for disruption and angiogenesis in its pathologic forms may be revealed. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The endothelium plays a critical role in vascular development and pattern formation during embryogenesis, and endothelial cells regulate vessel wall homeostasis, tissue response to ischemia, and vascular regeneration through their effects on vasomotor function and inflammation, angiogenesis, and progenitor cell dynamics.  Our overall goal is to determine the events that contribute to vascular differentiation and morphogenesis, with the anticipation that these same processes are recapitulated in angiogenesis-dependent events in the adult.\n",

      "Part 1.The optical network of the future will have orders of magnitude increase in data rates, due at least partially to the increase in big-data transactions. These create the need for fast scheduling of network resources and agile network adaptation to most efficiently move the data across the network.  This project proposes to investigate a cognitive network management and control system, which 'senses' current network conditions and uses this information to satisfy overall performance goals. This project will be the first comprehensive research on cognitive optical network management and control. The goal is for agile automated adaptation to replace current slow, manually-driven management and control practices. The fruits of this research will have implications for next generation wireless networks and power grid systems and for fast detection of extreme events that can significantly disrupt networks. Part 2.Current optical networks are operated with predominantly static connections, with lightpaths changed quasi-statically and often remaining unchanged for months. Present methods of setting up a wavelength path result in slow changes to the network (~20 min setup times), as each of the network elements along the path is gradually tuned to avoid instabilities and transient impairments arising from rapidly introducing another optical channel into the network. Large flow and other traffic dynamics will require bandwidth adaptations of the order of ~100mS-1S.  In today's optical networks, the link quality of all adjacent wavelengths is monitored as the lightpath is turned on in several steps. The number of network parameters and their short coherence time in dynamic future networks render acquiring the complete state information of the network impractical. The idea of this project is to sense and control a small subset of the parameters with the 'largest' information content and use their relationship to tune the network. Cognitive techniques that need to be incorporated in such a strategy include sampling of network and link parameters, applying data analytics to learn behavior and cognitive techniques to operate networks, and inferring network state and optimizing performance without placing an undue network control and management communications burden on the network. This research will consider both dynamic per-session scheduling, rerouting/load-balancing and topology reconfiguration to optimize network performance.\n",

      "--------------------\n",
      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Studies are proposed to advance understanding of the organization of human memory and the nature of memory disorders. The work involves six studies, which are organized around three topics that have been prominent in recent discussions of memory and memory impairment: A) Recent memory and remote memory; B) Recognition memory and the human hippocampus; C) Working memory and the medial temporal lobe. A salient aspect of the proposed work is the opportunity to continue study of our population of memory-impaired patients with bilateral lesions limited to the hippocampus or with larger medial temporal lobe lesions. Many of these patients are veterans. Our population of amnesic study patients, including the veterans, is one of the very few such populations available anywhere and is the best characterized in terms of detailed, quantitative neuroanatomy. A second and complementary aspect of the proposed work is neuroimaging studies of learning and memory in healthy individuals using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The following six studies are proposed: A) Recent memory and remote memory (an fMRI study of healthy volunteers). This is a prospective study of recent and remote memory, testing memory in the scanner for material that was learned 1 hr to 1 month earlier. We will also determine how brain activity in response to the new items that are presented during scanning is related to how novel these items are judged to be during scanning and how well these items are remembered in a later memory test. In this way, we will assess brain activity both as it relates to the age of a memory (1hr to 1 month) and also as it relates to the formation of new memories. Ba) Recognition memory and source memory (an fMRI study of healthy volunteers). We will use an improved and novel design asking whether activity in the hippocampus and perirhinal cortex during learning is differentially predictive of subsequent recognition memory and the subsequent ability to remember the context in which material was learned. This study addresses a fundamental issue: how sharp is the division of labor within medial temporal lobe structures? Bb) Remember (R) and Know (K) responses after hippocampal damage. We will ask whether the hippocampus selectively supports recollection (i.e., memory for the context in which learning occurred), or whether the hippocampus has a broader role in memory that includes the ability to detect simple familiarity. Bc) Recognition memory for faces. We will ask whether the capacity for face learning and face recognition is organized differently than the capacity to learn and recognize other kinds of material (e.g., specifically words and scenes). Is face memory hippocampus-dependent? Ca) Working memory for object-place associations. We will use a novel change-detection task to determine the working memory capacity for object-place associations and will ask whether working memory for this domain of material is independent of the medial temporal lobe. Cb) Relational working memory at short lag times. We will ask whether working memory is intact or impaired after medial temporal lobe damage as measured by tasks that assess relational memory for locations within complex scenes. These two studies (Ca and Cb) reassess the classical distinction between short-term and long-term memory. The issue hinges on the difficulty in determining which process (short-term memory or long-term memory) is supporting task performance in any particular case. I have devised a method that can make this determination.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     The proposed work aims to understand the organization and function of the brain systems that support human memory and to illuminate the nature of memory disorders. Memory problems are commonly reported in conjunction with neurological and psychiatric illness and are a significant issue in veterans' health. Improved knowledge about how memory works, and about how memory fails after injury or disease, lays a foundation for the development of technology and interventions to help diagnose, treat, and prevent the diseases that affect memory, including Alzheimer's disease. Better knowledge about how memory works, and sometimes does not work, also provides a foundation for the assessment and treatment of age-related memory impairment, which is increasingly significant in our aging population and in aging veterans.\n",

      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Heart disease caused by the loss or dysfunction of cardiomyocytes is the leading cause of death worldwide. The adult mammalian heart possesses little regenerative potential and therefore displays fatal loss of function following myocardial infarction (MI) and other heart diseases. Fibrosis and scar formation due to activation of cardiac fibroblasts serve as barriers to cardiac regeneration and contribute to loss of contractile function, pathological remodeling and susceptibility to arrhythmias. Recently, combinations of cardiogenic transcription factors were shown to be capable of activating cardiac gene expression in fibroblasts in vitro. Moreover, we have shown that forced expression of four transcription factors in cardiac fibroblasts is sufficient to activate cardiac gene expression in vivo, leading to improvement of cardiac function and reduction of adverse ventricular remodeling following MI in mice. Although these reprogramming processes are not yet optimized, they hold great potential for eventual cardiac repair, avoiding many of the obstacles associated with cellular transplantation. The overall goals of this project are to further define the mechanisms involved in reprogramming of cardiac cell fate and to optimize the technology for reprogramming of fibroblasts to cardiomyocytes in vivo as a strategy for cardiac repair. We will also assess the ability of selected small molecules and microRNAs to enhance cardiac reprogramming in vivo as a strategy for restoration of cardiac function following MI. These studies will provide important new insights into the mechanisms of cardiac cell fate specification and differentiation and will pave the way toward innovative approaches for cardiac repair.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Ischemic heart disease resulting in myocardial infarction (MI) and heart failure is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States. Recent studies have suggested a new approach for restoration of cardiac function following MI, through conversion of cardiac fibroblasts into cardiomyocytes by the introduction of defined cardiac transcription factors. In this project, this approach will be optimized using combinations of cardiogenic transcription factors, small molecules and microRNAs and the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying cardiac reprogramming in vitro and in vivo will be defined.\n",

      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Asthma, a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways, is estimated by the World Health Organization to affect 150 million people worldwide and its global pharmacotherapeutic costs exceed $5 billion per year. Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC) provides clinical care to -7000 asthmatic children in the primary care and specialty clinics. Last year, over 3000 children were treated in the CCHMC Emergency Department with the primary diagnosis of an acute asthma exacerbation, and 885 patients (29.5%) were admitted to the hospital for management of acute asthma exacerbations. CCHMC has invested considerable resources to promote asthma research including the establishment of the Division of Asthma Research, which has partnered with the Asthma Center to create a comprehensive Asthma Program, which now provides a central base for the clinical and research activities for asthma at CCHMC. Patients suffering from asthma share similar clinical symptoms, but the disease is heterogenous in terms of phenotypes and natural history 3, 4. This heterogeneity contributes to the difficulty in both studying and treating asthma. The heterogeneity in asthma is poorly understood and the mechanisms by which genetic and environmental influences impact asthma development and asthma disease expression are largely unknown. As such, the proposed Asthma Research Core has the central goal of improving the understanding of the heterogeneity in asthma. In order to accomplish this goal, we propose 2 aims: Aim #1: To recruit or promote a new faculty member into the tenure track to develop a research program focused a topic relevant to elucidating the mechanisms contributing to asthma heterogeneity. Aim #2: To develop a pilot research program in Asthma Research to support new faculty in the tenure track in the areas outlined above.    The frequency of absent or incomplete efficacy in asthma treatment is as high as 70%, due to the inherent heterogeneity in asthma phenotypes caused by multiple genetic and environmental influences. The central goal of this proposal is to improve the understanding of the heterogeneity in asthma. Improved understanding of asthma phenotypes will enable informed personalized treatment plans and likely will result in substantial reduction in asthma expenditures.\n",

      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Parkinson disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder after Alzheimer's disease. Although dopamine replacement therapy improves the functional prognosis of PD, there is currently no treatment that prevents the progression of the disease. The etiology of PD is not well understood. Most of the PD cases are sporadic. However, approximately 5-10% of PD patients may have a clear familial history, exhibiting a classical recessive or dominant Mendelian mode of inheritance. Genetic studies in the past more than 10 years have played a vital role in understanding the etiology and pathogenic mechanism of PD. But, the power of genetic study is greatly limited because it requires sufficient number of informative meiosis, i.e. large families with both normal and affected members, especially when great genetic heterogeneity exists. It is particularly a difficult task for most of the late onset neurodegenerative disorders, including PD. Because PD is a late-onset disease with an average age of onset between 60 and 80 years, it is practically rather difficult to collect large PD families and DNA samples. Collection of a large PD family with 2-3 generations normally takes decades. Thus, collection of the large kindreds with PD represents a significant hurdle for identification of new PD-causing genes. Through a 19-year collaborative effort initiated from 1992, we and our collaborators have identified a large PD family with 67 members, among whom 11 members are affected. We have collected clinical information and DNA samples from 62 members, including DNA samples from 10 affected individuals. During this period, two affected and one unaffected members died and were autopsied. Pathological analysis of the two autopsy samples revealed Parkinson pathology, including typical Lewy bodies. But the unaffected member did not show PD pathology. These data suggest that the PD in this kindred is similar to idiopathic PD. Supported by the American Parkinson Disease Association (APDA); we excluded mutations in currently known PD-causing genes, indicating a novel PD locus. We then carried out a genome-wide linkage analysis. The known PD-loci were excluded and a candidate PD-linked locus was suggested on the short arm of chromosome 20. This project is designed to identify a novel PD-causing gene by combined use of the recently developed exome sequencing approach and the unique resources that we have accumulated in the past 19 years. The candidate gene identified in this PD family will be further tested in over 500 familial PD probands. This gene may represent the third gene with a high penetrance for autosomal dominant PD. Completion of this project may not only lead to identification of the genetic basis of PD in this kindred, but also provides the PD research community with a novel molecular target for further studies of the disease mechanisms, biological pathways and potential therapeutic strategies.

      "The IL-2 receptor and related cytokine receptor systems are being studied to clarify the T cell immune response in normal, neoplastic, and immunodeficient states. Following T-cell activation by antigen, the magnitude and duration of the T-cell immune response is determined by the amount of IL-2 produced, levels of receptors expressed, and time course of each event. The IL-2 receptor contains three chains, IL-2Ra, IL-2Rb, and gc. Dr. Leonard cloned IL-2Ra in 1984, we discovered IL-2Rb in 1986, and reported in 1993 that mutation of the gc chain results in X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (XSCID, which has a T-B+NK- phenotype) in humans. We reported in 1995 that mutations of the gc-associated kinase, JAK3, result in an autosomal recessive form of SCID indistinguishable from XSCID and in 1998 that T-B+NK+ SCID results from mutations in the IL7R gene. Based on work in our lab and others, gc was previously shown to be shared by the receptors for IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, IL-15, and IL-21. We also previously characterized genes that were induced or repressed by IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, and IL-15, including showing the negative regulation of the IL-7 receptor alpha chain, a finding with implications in understanding how IL-2 can promote cell death, and the positive regulation of a dual specificity phosphatase, DUSP5, that negatively regulates IL-2-mediated activation of ERK kinases. T helper cell differentiation is critical for normal immune responses, with Th1 differentiation being important for host defense to viruses and other intracelllular pathogens, Th2 differentiation being vital in allergic disorders and related to helminths, and Th17 differentiation being vital in a range of inflammatory disorders, including psoriasis and inflammatory bowel disease. We previously showed that IL-2 is important for Th2 differentiation and reported that IL-2 regulates expression of the IL-4 receptor in a STAT5-dependent manner and critically controls priming of cells for Th2 differentiation. Moreover, using genome-wide Illumina-based ChIP-Seq (chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled to DNA sequencing) analysis, we had discovered broad regulation of Th2 differentiation via STAT5A and STAT5B, substantially extending earlier studies focused on STAT5A. Moreover, we had discovered that IL-2-mediated IL-4Ra induction was critical in priming cells for Th2 differentiation. In the prior year, we substantially extended these findings by showing that IL-2 via STAT5 induces expression of IL-12Rb1 and IL-12Rb2 and that the induction of IL-12Rb2 is critical for Th1 differentiation and we defined the mechanism of regulation of IL-12Rb2. Additionally, we showed that IL-2 via STAT5 also regulates the T box protein, T-bet. Interestingly, in contrast to the induction of IL-12R proteins, IL-2 inhibits expression of IL-6Ra and gp130, helping to explain the inhibition of Th17 differentiation. Consistent with the ability of Tbx21 to inhibit Th17 differentiation, expression of Tbx21 in Th17 cells resulted in increased IFNg but decreased expression of IL-17A. These results indicated a very broad effect of IL-2 via STAT5 on T helper cell differentiation.In the current review year, we have continued to study the role of IL-2 in Th differentiation, extending findings to Th9 differentiation. We also have continued our studies of the role of STAT5 tetramerization in vivo, with our initial report having been in the prior year.During the past year, we collaborated with Dr. K. Christopher Garcia at Stanford, studying the actions of wild type IL-2 versus novel IL-2 variants, a project with potential clinical ramifications. These studies in part use the pmel-1 T cell receptor transgenic model of adoptive immunotherapy for cancer in collaboration with Dr. Nicholas Restifo, NCI. We also collaborated with Dr. Garcia on a project in which the three dimensional structure of IL-2 complexed to its receptor was compared to that of IL-15 bound to its receptor. These studies, reported in the past year, have provided key mechanistic and structural insights into the functional differences between IL-2 and IL-15, which are highly related and share IL-2Rbeta and gc as receptor components but nevertheless possess distinctive biological functions. Although IL-2 primarily signals via cis-signaling and IL-15 via trans-signaling, these cytokines have essentially identical activation of STAT, PI3K/Akt, and Ras/MAPK signaling pathways. Moreover, gene expression profiles are very similar, although not identical. Thus, these cytokines have almost indistinguishable signaling properties despite different biological responses. This study has substantially elucidated structural and mechanistic aspects of IL-2 and IL-15 signaling. We previously reported the generation of IL-2/IL-21 dual reporter BAC transgenic mice. These mice allow one to observed through surrogate fluorescent markers the relative induction of these cytokines in different cells. Using these mice, we previously demonstrated a key role for IL-21 in a model mouse system for experimental autoimmune uveitis, and we had demonstrated the existence of IL-2, IL-21, and IL-2/IL-21 double expressing cells in the retina, consistent with a role for this cytokine in the disease process. We are continuing to develop studies with these valuable animals, with the intent of learning more about the roles of IL-2 and IL-21 in vivo.We also have the long-term goal of identifying new causes of human immunodeficiency and other hematological diseases.Overall, these studies help to improve our understanding of signaling by gc family cytokines. These findings clarify basic molecular mechanisms that are relevant to normal and pathological immune cell function, including allergy, autoimmunity, and cancer.\n",

      "ï»¿   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to explore the possibility of using fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) to study traumatic brain injury (TBI). This research is important because TBI is a major health problem. TBI occurs with high incidence, annually affecting about 1 in 500 people in the U.S., and it is associated with lifelong debilitating physical, cognitive, behavioral, and emotional outcomes. This research is also important because there are no therapies currently available to improve TBI outcomes. Since 1985, at least 21 clinical trials have been conducted, and none have shown a significant benefit in TBI outcomes. The failure to develop therapies is likely due to the complexity of TBI, both in terms of the severity and spatial distribution of injury to the brain and the elaborate responses of the brain to injury. Therefore, there is a need for new experimental models that can help us understand the main cellular and molecular mechanisms that underlie TBI outcomes, with the potential for identifying novel targets for diagnostic and therapeutic intervention. Our fly TBI model is significant because (1) it uses a mechanical force to inflict brain injury, similar to mechanisms that commonly occur in humans, (2) it generates a continuum of injury severity that predicts outcome severity, (3) it generates injury in a reproducible manner, making it possible to determine the contribution of genetic and environmental variables to outcomes, (4) it produces injury outcomes that mimic clinically relevant outcomes of TBI in humans, (5) it uses standardized experimental protocols that are affordable, simple, and widely applicable, and (6) it is supported by the unparalleled knowledge of the fly nervous system and experimental tools that are available for flies. To achieve the goal of determining the extent of similarity between fly and human TBI, we propose to identify genes and secondary events associated with death following TBI.\n",

While we have gained extensive knowledge regarding the mechanisms that determine the specificity of the adaptive immune response, very little is known about the mechanisms that determine the recognition of HIV-1 by the innate immune response. However, not only is the innate immune response critical in viral containment at a time when the adaptive immune response is just developing, it is also critical in shaping the function of the subsequent adaptive immune response. Therefore comprehensive studies aimed at deconstructing this early critical arm of the immune response, and its relationship to the adaptive immune response, are necessary to begin to more globally understand the correlates of protective immunity.

      "PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions): This is an application for renewal of the George M. O'Brien Kidney Center at Yale. This center was established with the overarching goal to facilitate basic, translational and clinical research that will advance the prevention and treatment of kidney diseases. Major research areas of emphasis are renal epithelial cell biology and physiology; inherited kidney disease and kidney development; acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD); and vascular biology, inflammation and glomerular disease. A critically important benefit of the Center is to provide renal investigators both at Yale and across the country with access to highly specialized services not otherwise routinely available to support their research. To this end, the Center includes three cores to provide small animal physiology and phenotyping services to enable detailed characterization of renal function at the level of the tubule, the kidney, and the intact organism in normal animals and in animal models of renal injury and kidney disease; provide mouse genetics and cell line services to develop novel animal models and kidney cell lines to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying normal renal function and the pathophysiology of kidney diseases; and provide human genetics and clinical research services to enhance the ability of renal investigators to apply advanced genetic and genomic technologies to human investigation. Our cores currently have a combined user base of approximately 90 investigators, including over 40 at outside institutions. A Pilot and Feasibility Program has the goals of providing initial project funding for young investigators, attracting new investigators into the field of kidney disease research, and fostering translational and clinical studies directly related to kidney diseases. In addition, an Enrichment Program enhances kidney disease research by maximizing interaction and information sharing among renal investigators and trainees, and by providing activities to enhance recruitment and education of all levels of trainees from undergraduate students to postdoctoral fellows.\n",

      "ï»¿   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Protein synthesis is an essential metabolic process in all bacteria and a target for the development of new antibiotics. In our initially funded SCORE grant we developed an amino acylation/translation (A/T) system from P. aeruginosa based on polyU mRNA directed protein synthesis. This system was optimized and developed into a platform to perform high throughput screening of chemical compounds against the activity of the system. During this period a number of inhibitory compounds (six) were identified and characterized and developed into lead compounds. A small (5-6) congener group was built around six of the lead compounds. The goal of the current proposal is to develop a lead series around each of these lead compounds as well as to continue discovery of additional compounds that inhibit growth of pathogenic bacteria. To develop a lead series we will carry out structure activity relationship (SAR) studies to increase the inhibitory potency, solubility, ADME and abilit to inhibit biofilm formation. At the same time we will attempt to decrease the potential for drug-drug induced enzyme inhibition and toxicity to human cell lines. In the continued discovery process, we will actively recruit collaborators doing work in isolation of natural compounds to test against our system for identification of new inhibitory compounds as well as obtain small focused synthetic compound libraries. The IC50 as well as the MIC against a panel of pathogenic bacteria will initially be determined for each new inhibitor discovered. These data willdetermine if new hit compounds enter SAR studies as described above.  Next, we propose to expand the A/T minimal protein synthesis system into a more natural like protein synthesis system. During the initial grant period, we were able to accomplish much more than was proposed. We have cloned, expressed, and isolated 11 additional proteins involved in protein synthesis: seven additional aaRS proteins, three translation initiation factors (IF-1, IF-2, and IF3) and the methionyl-tRNA formyltransferase. Incorporation of these proteins into the A/T assay, along with a designer natural like mRNA, allowing translation of a short peptide will allow us to screen for inhibitors of the ribosome and 15 accessory proteins in one assay. We have functional assays developed for each component of the system and will be able to quickly determine the molecular target of an inhibitor. This system will be developed and optimized based on the experience gained in the initial funding period. Screening of compound libraries will continue to be carried out in a high throughput format using scintillation proximity assays (SPA).  Four of the lead compounds inhibit protein synthesis by inhibiting the activity of PheRS. To determine mechanism of action of these inhibitory compounds we will evaluate promising lead compounds for their ability to generate spontaneous mutants or develop resistant after serial sub-culturing of hypersensitive strains of P. aeruginosa. We will screen for mutations in the gene encoding PheRS. The structure for P. aeruginosa PheRS has been solved and we will collaborate with Dr. Kotsikorou at UTPA and use the crystal structure and molecular modeling methods to explain the effects of the mutations on resistance to the antibacterial compounds. We will also model the binding of the compounds in the active site of PheRS to better understand the mechanism of inhibitory activity.\n",

      "visual retinal vision eye retina glaucoma cortex degeneration amd photoreceptor\n",
      "--------------------\n",
      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This research aims at understanding how visual information is processed in the eye and brain. Vision begins in the retina, a complex network of neurons in the back of the eye where visual images are converted into streams of action potentials that travel through the fibers of the optic nerve to the brain. There the signals pass through the thalamus to the visual cortex, where much larger circuits of neurons are brought to bear. Recent research has changed our view of the retina: Whereas it used to be considered a simple prefilter for the visual image, new results suggest that the retina computes quite specific features of the scene and conveys those to the brain through many parallel channels. The proposed research will build on this work, both to further our understanding of how the retina converts images into spike trains, and to investigate how this code for visual scenes can be used by the brain for further processing. This will be addressed in a collaborative project that combines experimental as well as theoretical and computational approaches. The specific aims are: (1) to unify diverse functions of the retina under a common mathematical formalism, and use this to discover new functions; (2) to determine how our brain might process retinal signals for rapid understanding of a new scene; (3) to explain how our fine vision can be so acute, given that the eyes are never holding still.  If successful, this research will offer benefits on multiple fronts. First, it will expand our notions of what a neural circuit like the retina can compute and how the information is encoded in its output, an important goal of systems neuroscience. Second, it will help resolve two mysteries of visual processing, relating to both its remarkable speed and its high acuity. Third, progress in these areas will benefit brain science in general. Many of the circuit motifs encountered in the retina are repeated in other brain areas, and may well serve similar network-level functions. Finally, an improved understanding of early visual function can change how one thinks about visual diseases and therapy. For example, it now appears that certain functions previously assigned to the visual cortex already happen in the retina; if so, then retinal dysfunction could also have much more elaborate effects on visual experience. Conversely, in efforts to treat retinal degeneration by electronic or genetic prostheses one needs to know which aspects of retinal function the prosthesis should emulate to support visual perception.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project concerns basic research into the function of the early visual system, from the eye to the visual cortex. It will lead to a better understanding of how we see, specifically which parts of vision are handled by the eye versus the brain. This in turn may improve methods of diagnosis for visual dysfunction. Such an understanding will also aid in the development of visual prostheses designed to replace a degenerated retina.\n",

Disruption of cell-cell adhesion leads to loss of epithelial cell organization, increasd cell migration, and loss of contact-inhibition of cell proliferation, which are characteristic of mny genetic diseases including cancer. Thus the RATIONALE for our work is that a deep mechanistic understanding of cell-cell adhesion will provide fundamental insights into the regulation of epithelial tissue organization in normal and disease states. Our CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS is that cell-cell adhesion maintains epithelial homeostasis by controlling cytoskeleton organization and cell migration, and sequestering key signaling proteins that regulate cell proliferation. Our LONG- TERM OBJECTIVES are organized under 2 broad themes that address KEY CHALLENGES about: A. Mechanisms involved in cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion, cytoskeleton organization and regulation of cell migration; and B. Response of cell-cell adhesion complexes to perturbation by mechanical strain. Based on significant results and technology development during the preceding period of support, we can now address KEY QUESTIONS about: Theme A. The regulation of Î±E-catenin (A.1) and actin (A.2) dynamics during cell-cell adhesion, and the cross-talk between cadherin- and integrin-based adhesions that control the balance between cell-cell adhesion and migration (A.3); and Theme B. Upon mechanical strain and cell cycle re- entry, how Î²-catenin and Yap1 are Trans located to the nucleus (B.1), the role of actomyosin activity (B.2) and kinases (B.3) in activating Î²-cateninand Yap1, and the involvement of additional junction-mediated signaling pathways in cell cycle regulation (B.4). Completion of these studies will answer KEY QUESTIONS about the role of cell-cell adhesion in cytoskeleton organization and cell migration, and sequestering key signaling proteins that regulate cell proliferation. These studies address fundamental CHALLENGES in understanding the regulation of epithelial tissue organization in normal and disease states.\n",

      "hearing speech auditory language cochlear processing loss noise perception sound\n",
      "--------------------\n",
      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent studies have shown that children with hearing loss who are identified through universal newborn hearing screening programs are not as delayed in speech and language development as children who are identified at later ages. It appears, however, that even with early identification and intervention (including amplification), these children are still delayed relative to children with normal hearing. In the current proposal, it is hypothesized that these persistent delays are the result of reduced auditory access and limited auditory experiences. Specifically, one consequence of congenital hearing loss is limited auditory access to speech. Reduced auditory experience in infancy may compromise auditory perceptual foundations upon which later language stages are constructed. It is critical to determine the constellation of auditory factors that support early learning and the experiences that facilitate continued language development throughout childhood. The overall goal of this project is to explore ways in which to enhance auditory access and auditory experiences in young children with hearing loss. Current hearing instruments and other assistive listening devices appear to be incapable of fully compensating for the perceptual degradation of hearing loss. In addition the negative influence of factors such as distance, noise, and reverberation are magnified for children with hearing loss, thus reducing the number and quality of auditory experiences. Two areas associated with reduced auditory access for children with hearing loss will be investigated in the studies described in this proposal. First, the influence of selected forms of advanced signal processing on speech perception, speech production, novel-word learning, and ease of listening will be explored. Second, experiments will be conducted to determine whether the quality and quantity of auditory experiences can be enhanced for the purpose of accelerating auditory skill development and adaptation to new signal-processing algorithms. In combination, these studies potentially could result in the development of alternative intervention strategies leading to more successful speech and language outcomes for children with hearing loss.\n",

      "--------------------\n",
      "Background: Almost 2 billion individuals are infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB). The human cost of TB is enormous. Despite the fact that excellent treatment is available, at least 1.4 million deaths annually are due to TB, and it is the world's leading cause of death from infectious disease. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that >40% of the 10.7 million individuals who fell ill with active TB in 2015 were not diagnosed by their countryâs healthcare system. WHO stakeholder analysis stated that the most urgent need is for an accurate, rapid, biomarker-based non-sputum TB triage test that uses a readily accessible sample (e.g., saliva, blood, urine). The desired TB triage test would minimally have 90% sensitivity and 70% specificity, which would significantly narrow the population that needs a costly confirmatory test for active TB disease.Rationale: Recently, several reports have been published by ourselves and others on putative blood biomarkers that reflect the host response to Mtb infection through human gene expression patterns associated with TB disease. The transcriptional state of circulating blood cells reacts to Mtb infection, and this forms the foundation of a simple to administer blood test. We have discovered and preliminarily tested a gene expression signature based on three genes (GBP5, DUSP3, and KLF2) with excellent predictive powers to discriminate between healthy individuals, those with active TB, and those with other diseases (e.g., a triage TB test). Further, we have also discovered that our three-gene signature signals well before Mtb can be detected in sputum and in fact can differentiate active TB months before it becomes contagious (preclinical TB).Objective: Our primary long-term objective is to develop a finger-stick triage test using non-stimulated blood that meets or exceeds WHO Target Product Profiles for a rapid biomarker-based non-sputum-based triage test for detecting TB (= 90% sensitivity when compared with the confirmatory test for pulmonary TB and = 70% specificity against a microbiological reference standard). Our secondary objective is to extend our finger-stick test to include biomarkers of preclinical TB.Specific Aims: We will first use bioinformatics on our worldwide multi-cohort database of RNA expression to select 1-5 genes, which will increase the robustness and performance of our three-gene signature to discriminate active TB, preclinical TB, and healthy, uninfected individuals (Aim 1). We will validate our TB signature using blood from 100 TB Index Cases and 450 household contacts in the Republic of Moldova and transfer the TB signature to a cartridge useable by GeneXpert or Omni Systems (Cepheid Corp., Sunnyvale, California) (Aim 2). Finally, we will test our preclinical research prototype cartridge using blood collected from 1,000 individuals who are being screened for TB in the Republic of Moldova (Aim 3).Impact: The long-term impact of a new, accurate triage test for TB will dramatically change the way millions of TB suspects are screened everywhere in the world and will likely lead to many more cases of TB being diagnosed and treated early. An accurate test for preclinical TB by diagnosing and treating TB before it becomes contagious would be a major step toward âthe elimination of TB as a public health treat by 2050.â The WHOâs global plan to eliminate TB focuses on early diagnosis of TB and systematic screening of contacts and high-risk groups. Our test would facilitate both of these testing goals simultaneously and additionally provide for the identification of individuals who harbor TB but are not infectious to others. TB treatment is low-cost and effective, but new, highly accurate diagnostic tests are necessary to find and treat patients appropriately.Relevancy: Our proposal is important and relevant to developing improvements in the diagnosis of TB, which is a Peer Reviewed Medical Research Program Fiscal Year 2017 Topic Area, and specifically our proposal targets the focus area of âDevelopment of a diagnostic assay that can be used at the point of care to rapidly and accurately diagnose tuberculosis.â Early case detection and rapid treatment with appropriate drugs are considered the most effective control strategies to reduce TB transmission. Civilians are at increased risk for exposure to TB from many transmission routes including exposure to TB-infected persons entering the United States undetected, long airplane flights, and increased exposure to TB during international travel for leisure or business. US troops are at increased risk of transmission of TB in settings with extreme crowding or limited ventilation, such as berthing areas in ships, barracks, and/or prisons, as well as exposure from visitors to bases, and environments encountered on tactical or humanitarian missions. A new test that offers for the first time a reliable test that can diagnose TB before it becomes contagious is an innovative way to stop the TB epidemic and help the US Armed Forces, US, and WHO reach its goal of eradicating TB as a public health threat by 2050.\n",

      "ï»¿   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The impact of mitochondrial biology on human cancers is broad because these organelles are critical regulators of metabolism, proliferation, and apoptosis. Indeed, mitochondrial aberrations are common in multiple cancer types --- not only do mitochondrial dysfunctions correlate with disease pathogenesis, but aberrant mitochondria also negatively impact upon chemotherapeutic success. Within a cell, mitochondrial homeostasis is maintained by a process referred to as  mitochondrial dynamics , which is essential for mitochondrial genome integrity, efficient ATP generation, managing ROS, and the rapid distribution of mitochondrial metabolites. Mitochondrial dynamics result from the cumulative nature of two opposing forces: mitochondrial division and mitochondrial fusion. Recent published work from my group demonstrated: (1) mitochondrial division is chronically enhanced in RAS-transformed murine cells and human cancer lines harboring mutations within the MAPK pathway, (2) the mitochondrial division machinery is essential for cellular transformation, (3) targeted therapies that inhibit oncogenic MAPK signaling turn off the mitochondrial division machinery, and (4) chronic mitochondrial division is sufficient to initiate mitochondrial dysfunction and cancer cell metabolism. For decades, the presence of mtDNA mutations and mitochondrial dysfunction in cancer has been described, but the molecular mechanisms that drive these changes and their impact on cancer biology remain speculative. While others and we identified that mitochondrial division is requisite to cancer-associated mitochondrial dysfunction and is targeted by oncogenic MAPK pathway inhibitors, the molecular mechanisms linking mitochondrial division, mitochondrial dysfunction, and cancer cell survival are poorly understood. We hypothesize that oncogenic MAPK signaling induces chronic mitochondrial fragmentation, which supports mutation of the mitochondrial genome and subsequent functional heterogeneity within the mitochondrial network. This project emerged following years of effort to identify how mitochondrial division contributes to cancer biology, andwe propose three complementary specific aims. Aim 1: Establish that chronic mitochondrial division is responsible for cancer-associated mtDNA mutations and subsequent mitochondrial dysfunction in melanocytes. Aim 2: Demonstrate that chronic mitochondrial division induced mtDNA mutations link mitochondrial heterogeneity, tumorigenic potential, and metabolic plasticity. Aim 3: Reveal the broad requirement for chronic mitochondrial division in oncogenic transformation of cells and tissues. These aims will be achieved by using next-generation mtDNA sequencing, state-of-the-art mitochondrial function assays, and metabolomics approaches. Together, the results of this application will reveal that: (1) chronic mitochondrial division is permissive for mtDNA mutations, mitochondrial dysfunction, and tumorigenesis; and (2) proof-of- concept evidence that pharmacologically targeting chronic mitochondrial division may provide therapeutic potential to prevent and treat cancer.\n",

      "Hepatitis C virus is both difficult to treat and a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. It is not understood how hepatitis C establishes infection nor how some patients clear infection. To this end 83 humans exposed to hepatitis C were studied in protocol 00-DK-0221. The immune response (both antibody and T cell) was closely followed and is being characterized. The study is in collaboration with Dr. Rehermann. As an extension of this 28 patients with acute hepatitis C have been followed and treated as indicated. Twenty-five patients (16 women; mean age 43 years) had adequate follow up to be included in an analysis.  Symptoms in the acute phase were reported by 80% and jaundice by 40%. Two patients (8%) developed ascites and acute liver failure but both survived.  Genotype 1 was most frequent (72%) but many patients (20%) could not be genotyped.   Serum aminotransferase levels and HCV RNA levels fluctuated greatly; 18% of patients were intermittently negative for HCV RNA.   In follow up, 5 patients recovered spontaneously whereas 20 developed chronic hepatitis C or received interferon-based therapy during the acute phase.  Among 15 patients treated during the acute phase with peginterferon with or without ribavirin for 24 weeks, all became HCV RNA negative within 4 to 8 weeks, and all except two achieved a sustained virological response with the exceptions being HIV-positive.  Side effects (particularly psychiatric) were common and limited the duration of therapy in 30% of patients.  To further understand the virological determinants of infection and the development of chronicity, the hepatitis C virus sequence in the early stages of infection has been determined from the same patients. In particular the sequencing effort is focused on the viral sequence before and after treatment, in the two patients who were HIV positive and relapsed. The complete sequence has been determined and is now being analyzed. A second laboraratory project has been to study the nature of late relapse after treatment for hepatitis C. The first 103 patients who achieved a sustained virologic response at the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center were reviewed. Three patients had a late relapse. The viral sequence from these patients was studied from before treatment, from the liver at the time of sustained virologic response, and from the serum at the time of documented relapse. The viral sequences obtained from before treatment, the liver at the time of sustained virologic response, and from the serum at the time of relapse were all virtually identical proving relapse and not reinfection. A third laboratory project currently underway is to use viral sequencing to understand discrepancies in commercial genotyping assays.A collaborative project with Drs. Natanya Sandler and Danny Doueck was to determine the relationship between markers of microbial translocation and chronic liver disease. We investigated whether the extent and progression of liver disease in patients with chronic HBV or HCV infection are associated with microbial translocation and subsequent activation of monocytes. In a retrospective study, we analyzed data from 16 patients with minimal fibrosis, 68 with cirrhosis, and 67 uninfected volunteers. We analyzed plasma levels of soluble CD14 (sCD14), intestinal fatty acid binding protein, and interleukin-6 by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) by the limulus amebocyte lysate assay, at presentation and after antiviral treatment. Compared with uninfected individuals, HCV- and HBV-infected individuals had higher plasma levels of LPS, intestinal fatty acid binding protein (indicating enterocyte death), sCD14 (produced upon LPS activation of monocytes), and interleukin-6. Portal hypertension, indicated by low platelet counts, was associated with enterocyte death (P = .045 at presentation, P < .0001 after therapy). Levels of sCD14 correlated with markers of hepatic inflammation (P = .02 for aspartate aminotransferase, P = .002 for ferritin) and fibrosis (P < .0001 for &#947;-glutamyl transpeptidase, P = .01 for alkaline phosphatase, P < .0001 for &#945;-fetoprotein). Compared to subjects with minimal fibrosis, subjects with severe fibrosis at presentation had higher plasma levels of sCD14 (P = .01) and more hepatic CD14(+) cells (P = .0002); each increased risk for disease progression (P = .0009 and P = .005, respectively). LPS-induced local and systemic inflammation is associated with cirrhosis and predicts progression to end-stage liver disease in patients with HBV or HCV infection.A second type of chronic hepatitis studied is hepatitis D. Hepatitis D is the most aggressive form of viral hepatitis as well as the most difficult to treat. Interferon therapy is the standard approach. Patients are typically treated for 6 months to a year. Relapse after cessation of therapy is the norm. In protocol 01-DK-0247 patients are treated with peginterferon for 5 years. The dose is titrated to maintain normal ALT and minimize side effects. Patients are evaluated before initiating therapy, and after 1, 3, and 5 years. Patients are excluded if they do not meet protocol-defined criteria for response at the 1 year evaluation. Enrollment was planned for 10 - 20 patients. Thirteen patients have been enrolled, and of the 12 who have had one-year evaluations 10 have met the protocol definition of response. Most of the patients were male (11) and tended to have advanced disease (median baseline Ishak fibrosis - 4). Patients were treated for a mean duration of 144 weeks (range 6 - 300) at an average weekly peginterferon dose of 184 &#956;g. At one year of treatment, inflammatory scores were significantly improved (10.6  2.7 vs. 7  1.9, p<0.01) and this improvement persisted in 4 of 5 patients who had a 3 year biopsy scored. There was no difference in the fibrosis score. ALT decreased significantly after one year (136  143 vs. 46  13, p<0.05) and persistant biochemical response on treatment was achieved by 3 patients (27%). 3/13 patients (27%) lost HBsAg after 24, 37 and 202 weeks of treatment and developed HBs antibodies. Treatment was stopped in these patients at least 24 weeks later; the serological response was durable and was associated with persistent improvement of ALT and platelet count during follow-up. Two patients (15%) died during therapy, one from hepatocellular carcinoma and the other from herpes colitis. Both deaths were not considered related to treatment. There were no other serious adverse events and treatment was well-tolerated overall. 3 patients required a dose reduction due to cytopenias. The primary end point of the study is the evaluation after three years although it is planned to treat patients for 5 years. Hepatitis D viral RNA and hepatitis B surface antigen levels have been measured, the final analysis is currently being completed.\n",

      "ï»¿   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The study of the factors that control RNA expression to give rise to diverse cell types, from the same genome, has occupied scientists for more than 50 years. However, transcriptional regulation is just the beginning. Each expressed RNA can potentially adopt a new purpose as a function of its spatial position within a cell. RNA localization has been analyzed one RNA at a time because assaying RNA spatial organization on a systems-level is currently not possible. This Innovator proposal is focused on developing the methods to produce the first ever view of RNA localization on a transcriptome-wide level within cells.  We will develop a novel methodology to seek and find the cellular localization of every RNA within specific cellular locations. These methods are designed to be applicable to any cell type. By merging our technology with RNA sequencing we will construct  RNA Localization Heatmaps  to identify sites where certain RNAs are localized to. We will then integrate our data with existing datasets to understand how RNA-binding proteins direct RNAs to their cellular destinations. Our ultimate goal is to not only find where RNAs are, but also how they get there. Deciphering the molecular code for RNA organization will have broad impact on the biomedical community. Such knowledge could be used to better understand RNA-guided cellular reprogramming, design better RNA therapeutics, and further our understanding of how RNA localization contributes to normal and diseased phenotypes. This proposal is highly suitable for the New Innovator Award mechanism. Planned experiments will develop novel tools and methods to radically transform our understanding of cellular and RNA organization, while at the same time discovering an extended set of molecular  codes  that researchers could employ for RNA design.\n",

      "The benefits of physical activity for adults are well established, but less than one-third of older adults in theU.S. have achieved recommended levels of physical activity despite widespread clinical recommendationsto increase physical activity in recent years. Clinic-based approaches to increasing physical activity areexpensive, difficult to implement in busy practice settings, and have limited reach. Moreover, evidence ofthe efficacy of such approaches is equivocal. A population based approach may be a more effective andless costly strategy to increase levels of physical activity in older adults. Population studies of physicalactivity have demonstrated that each year, many sedentary older adults initiate physical activity, but anearly equal number of those who were active become sedentary. Among older adults initiating physicalactivity, only half continue to be active 3 months later.We hypothesize that a population based approach that emphasizes physical activity maintenance cansubstantially increase physical activity levels in a defined populations of older adults. This hypothesis istested in a 24-month randomized trial evaluating an innovative, theory-based behavioral intervention tomaintain physical activity in a random sample of 50-70 year old adults who have recently become at leastmoderately active. One thousand (1000) subjects will be randomized to one of two experimental groups: 1)a  usual care  control group, and 2) an interactive phone- and mail-based intervention program tailored tomaintaining physical activity in older adults. The primary outcome measures are: 1) physical activity,assessed as kcals/wk expenditure; and 2) physical activity maintenance, assessed as follow-up kcals/wkexpenditure relative to baseline. Careful measurement of the penetration of the intervention into a wellcharacterized older adult population, and the costs of the intervention, will be assessed. Psychosocial andbehavioral mediators of physical activity maintenance will also be examined.Study results will be relevant to policy makers, health promotion practitioners and health plans, and willprovide practical information on the effectiveness, population penetration, and costs of an interventiondesigned to maximize population levels of physical activity amon 9 older adults.\n",

      "Stroke remains the most disabling of any neurological disease, as well as one of the leading causes of death in the United States. The annual incidence of strokes in the US is now neariy 750,000 and the most recent cost estimates of stroke care have been calculated as a staggering $50 billion. Over the next decade, the impact of stroke is likely to increase. The aging of our population and the changing race-ethnic composition could lead to an increased stroke incidence, mortality, morbidity and cost. The only approved acute therapy for stroke is IV tPA. Despite the excellent 3-month outcomes among those acute stroke patients treated within 3 hours, IV tPA is used in only 3-4% of patients suffering from stroke in the US. Part of the explanation for the inadequate penetration of IV tPA into stroke treatment stems from the public's lack of recognition of acute stroke symptoms, as well as the lack of infrastructure at the hospital level to expeditiously detect, triage and treat acute stroke patients.(1) In a North Carolina survey, 66% of hospitals did not have stroke protocols, and 82% did not have systems for rapid identification of acute stroke.(2) The Brain Attack Coalition of the American Heart Association has made recommendations for the establishment of primary stroke centers, and has more recentiy published a set of guidelines for the establishment of comprehensive stroke centers.(3-5) Based on these recommendations and a general awareness among interested participants, the acute stroke team is the cornerstone of the stroke center and consists of an interdisciplinary group of experienced healthcare workers dedicated to the delivery of eariy stroke care.(6) The 24-hour team coverage must be capable of responding rapidly to the need for diagnosing and managing acute stroke patients in the ER, as well as the hospital. Someone from the stroke team should be at the bedside within 15 minutes of being called.(7) Written treatment protocols are needed and have been shown to improve care of stroke patients and reduce IV tPA complications.(8-11) Such protocols should include the emergency care of stroke pafients, including eariy stabilization, initial diagnostic approaches, and the use of treatments that are based on guidelines or developed by the stroke team.(12)  In recent years great strides have been made in understanding the pathophysiology of ischemic stroke and testing and applying treatments for acute stroke aimed at reducing morbidity and mortality after stroke. Despite these advances, too few acute stroke patients are benefiting from these treatments. There is a gap in the ability to implement the successes of clinical trials to the treatment of stroke in the community. Two major goals of SPOTRIAS are to promote access to existing therapies through the enhancement of Stroke Center systems, and to develop new therapeufic approaches for acute stroke intervention.\n",

      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Seasonality has a major effect on the spatiotemporal dynamics of natural systems and their populations and is the driving force behind the transmission of influenza in temperate regions. Although the seasonality of influenza in temperate countries is widely recognized, inter-regional spread of influenza in the United States have not been well characterized. This research will study the seasonality of influenza throughout the United States by using weekly pneumonia and influenza (P&I) mortality to model inter-region and inter-city movement of seasonal influenza in the United States between 1968 and 2007. This project aims to identify the underlying wave of seasonal influenza spread in the United States and the dependence of the timing and spread of influenza on the dominant circulating influenza type or subtype in a given influenza season. This goal will be achieved by accomplishing the following aims: 1) identifying the spatial and temporal patterns of seasonal influenza in the U.S. from 1968 to 2007, 2) comparing the spatial and temporal patterns of seasonal influenza in the U.S. by dominant type or subtype of influenza, 3) identifying source locations of influenza transmission in the U.S., 4) and determining the dominant spreading process of seasonal influenza in the U.S. Average time to death from P&I will be used to determine the epidemic timing and direction of wave progression for each influenza season. It will also be used to identify seed locations for influenza transmission and assess the velocity of wave progression. Ordinary least squares will be used in order to develop linear trend surfaces for each influenza season and to depict the main trend in the spatial progression of each influenza season. Spatial autocorrelation will be used to detect the dominant spreading process of seasonal influenza in the U.S. (e.g. contagious, hierarchical, or mixed process). In addition, the average time seasonal influenza takes to spread across the United States and the average time between regional peak and national peak by dominant influenza subtype and season will be determined. Identifying spatiotemporal patterns could improve epidemic prediction and prevention. This research will determine the spatial and temporal characteristics of seasonal influenza in the U.S. and show if these characteristics differ by dominant influenza sub-type. Accomplishing this research will greatly aid public health professionals in refining influenza intervention strategies that include better placement and distribution of vaccines and other medicines.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The completion of the proposed research has broad application for the planning of intervention strategies for pandemic and epidemic influenza in the U.S. Knowledge of the timing and spatial spread of influenza could severely limit the morbidity and mortality associated with epidemic influenza, as well as with a future pandemic. The knowledge gained as a result of this dissertation will allow public health officials to refine currnt influenza intervention strategies in order to more effectively and efficiently utilize influenza interventions.\n",

      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Insulin resistance stands as a significant threat to public health worldwide, and a largely unmet medical need. To unravel the complex biology of this protean syndrome, we have endeavored to apply genetic techniques to probe gene function and tissue interactions related to metabolism, and identify tractable targets for pharmacological intervention in type 2 diabetes. Over the past five years, the notable contributions of this grant to our knowledge of the insulin resistance syndrome have been: (i) a critical reassessment of the relative roles of insulin- dependent and -independent mechanisms of glucose disposal in metabolic homeostasis; (ii) the discovery of mechanisms by which non-canonical sites of insulin action, such as central nervous system (CNS) and endocrine pancreas, play an early and decisive role in the progression from insulin resistance to diabetes; and (iii) the notion that pancreatic beta cells are an  insulin-sensitive  cell type. Building on these lessons, the PI proposes studies of the integrated physiology of insulin action that will focus primarily on the contribution of CNS, liver and enteroendocrine system to the insulin-resistant state. The PI presents data putatively identifying an  insulin-sensitive  neuron population, characterized by Glut4 expression; as well as a novel gut epithelial progenitor cell with the unique ability to give rise to bona fide insulin-secreting,  Beta-like  endocrine cells in vivo. Three aims are outlined: Aim 1 will tackle the role of insulin signaling in brain glucose metabolism, using a novel approach to identify Glut4-expressing neurons and characterize their contribution to systemic metabolism. Aim 2 will delve into the pathophysiology of hepatic insulin resistance, and specifically into the identification of transcription factors that cause the paradoxical admixture of increased glucose production and triglyceride synthesis that characterizes the diabetic liver. Aim 3 will study the role of insulin signaling in a newly identified sub-population of gut epithelial progenitor cells that express the insulin-regulated transcription factor Foxo1 and show the surprising ability to be reprogrammed into  Beta-like  cells that secrete insulin in response to glucose. The proposed body of work will advance our understanding of the insulin-resistant syndrome at the biochemical, genetic, and integrated physiological levels, with the ultimate goal of translating newly acquired information into innovative approaches to its treatment.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In the last decade, we endeavored to unravel the 'insulin code'-a concerted succession of biochemical and cell biological events that underlie the integrated physiology of insulin action. We documented the contribution of Insulin Receptor, its main substrates and signaling intermediates to the key abnormalities of insulin resistance: decreased glucose disposal, increased glucose production, and impaired pancreatic beta cell function. We used genetic techniques to probe hormonal and nutritional communication among different tissues, and analyze the progression from insulin resistance to overt diabetes. We demonstrated how tissues with insulin-dependent glucose disposal (muscle and fat) interact with those that utilize glucose independent of insulin (liver, brain, pancreatic islets) to determine various aspects of insulin resistance. We developed a theory integrating 2 cell function with insulin resistance; and delved into the pathophysiology of the brain's contribution to glucose homeostasis. We also examined the bimodal involvement of the liver in diabetes as a site of mixed sensitivity and resistance to insulin. In the process, we burrowed into the Foxo1 pathway, demonstrating the central position of this transcription factor in the regulation of hepatic glucose production and neuropeptide processing. Reversal of insulin resistance remains a critical goal of diabetes treatment, and arguably one of the largest unmet medical needs. Work supported by this grant has defined mechanisms that we believe to be new, linking insulin action in specific organs and cell types with the pathophysiology of insulin resistance, and disclosing biochemical and molecular circuits that can be exploited for diabetes treatment. We envision that the studies proposed for the next funding cycle will reveal new dimensions to the insulin resistance syndrome and expand the repertoire of currently available targets for diabetes therapy and prevention. The proposed experiments build on lessons of the past funding cycle to explore the contribution of newly identified mechanisms to metabolic homeostasis. The driving theme of our work is to define molecular pathways that can be enlisted in the clinic against insulin resistance.\n",

      "Since 1995, over 40 countries have adopted legislation that mandates women's participation in government, and these policies enjoy considerable support from international organizations, politicians, and activists.  Practitioners who seek to increase women's presence in office do so in large part because they believe it will provide normative benefits for women through improved policy representation.  Despite this widely held assumption, it is clear that in a number of cases increasing women's representation fails to transform the legislative agenda.  While in some countries women's increased participation alters policy representation-defined in this project as the adoption of legislation related to women's interests-in others the addition of female legislators has had only limited consequences.Why does increasing women's participation lead to such mixed results?  This project represents one of the first systematic efforts to carefully develop and test theoretical expectations concerning when and why increasing women's presence in national assemblies leads to greater attention to women's issues.  A series of empirical implications are developed that can be used to assess the correlations (or lack thereof) that are often found between women's presence in legislative assemblies and instance of women's policy representation.  These observable implications are used to establish when increases in women's presence in office cause policy adoption. The research design combines a cross-national statistical analysis on the adoption of legislation related to women's issues with a qualitative case study of women's representation in the Labour Party of Great Britain.Given the attention and resources that have been dedicated to increasing the number of women in national assemblies, elucidating the relationship between women's presence in office and legislative attention to women's issues is a timely project with obvious policy implications.  By illustrating that not all institutional settings facilitate the link between women's participation and representation, it helps to explain instances where female legislators fail to transform the legislative agenda.  For policy actors committed to increasing attention to women's issues, the theoretical framework also provides criteria for identifying cases in which women's greater participation may secure their policy representation.  Thus, in challenging the presumed link between the presence of female representation and attention to women's interests, the project provides a more nuanced interpretation as to whether increasing the number of women in office  matters  for legislative outcomes.\n",

HCV co-infection with HIV is very common with overall 25-30% of HIV-positive persons, particularly among drug abusers with up to 70% co-infection (2). HCV infection is a major risk factor for HCC development. HCV- associated end-stage of liver diseases is the leading indication for liver transplantation. Advances on HCV research have been significantly hampered by the lack of a robust cell culture HCV propagation system and reliable small animal models of HCV infection and replication. Recent breakthroughs have been the development of robust cell culture systems for replication of HCV replicon RNAs and production of infectious HCV, which allows genetic studies of the entire HCV life cycle. However, development of small animal models of HCV infection and replication is challenging and that the lack of a reliable small animal model represents a major barrier to HCV research. Recently, we have demonstrated that genotype 2a HCV RNA replicated efficiently in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) albeit inefficiently in mouse hepatocytes. More importantly, we have demonstrated that the cDNA-derived HCV RNA inside the cell resulted in robust production of infectious HCV. A recent study by Charlie Rice's group has demonstrated that the expression of human CD81 and occludin in mouse hepatocytes is essential and sufficient for infection of HCV pseudotyped particles. These remarkable advances provide a firm foundation to develop novel transgenic mouse models of HCV infection and replication. We hypothesize that cell type-specific cellular proteins are important for efficient HCV RNA replication and that transgenic mice expressing human CD81 and occludin in hepatocytes are susceptible to HCV infection. The overall goal of this exploratory research proposal is to develop novel transgenic HCV mouse models. Specifically, we will 1) identify cellular proteins important for efficient HCV RNA replication in mouse cells using proteomics, biochemical, and genetic complementation approaches (Specific Aim 1); 2) develop novel transgenic mice that either contain full-length cDNAs of luciferase-expressing JFH1 HCV RNAs or express both human CD81 and occludin under the control of a liver-specific promoter (Specific Aim 2); and 3) determine HCV infection and replication in transgenic mice using luciferase-expressing HCV in conjunction with the administration of mouse interferon and HCV NS3 protease- and NS5B polymerase-specific inhibitors (Specific Aim 3). The successful development of transgenic HCV mouse models will represent a paradigm shift in the field of HCV research and will allow us to determine the roles and mechanisms of action of viral and cellular proteins in HCV infection, replication, pathogenesis, and carcinogenesis as well as the effects of illicit drugs and alcohol on HCV replication and pathogenesis. Additionally, transgenic HCV mouse models will facilitate the anti-HCV drug discovery and HCV vaccine development to eventually control HCV infection.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection remains a major global health problem, affecting approximately 170 million people worldwide and 4 million Americans. Our overall goal of this research proposal is to develop novel transgenic HCV mouse models for the determination of the molecular mechanisms of HCV replication, pathogenesis, carcinogenesis, and the effects of illicit drugs and alcohol on HCV replication and pathogenesis. Additionally, transgenic HCV mouse models will facilitate the antiviral drug discovery and vaccine development to eventually control HCV infection.\n",

      "--------------------\n",
      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of this proposal is to determine how changes in intracellular Ca2+, the ultimate signal of electrical activity, regulate cardiac membrane excitability. Dysregulation of Ca2+, however, contributes to cardiac arrhythmias. Given the potential pathophysiological consequences, it is not surprising that many regulatory mechanisms have evolved to control Ca2+ entry. These include Ca2+-dependent inactivation (CDI) of CaV1.2 L- type Ca2+ channels the focus of the previous proposal and mechanisms newly described by us that derived from our studies on CDI. Here we focus on novel means by through which Ca2+ influences gating of multiple channels to shape the cardiac action potential and influence excitability. Three specific aims are proposed. In the first aim, we build upon preliminary data showing that structural determination of the Nav1.5 C terminus (CT) is feasible by NMR spectroscopy. We will determine the atomic structure of the putative Ca2+ regulatory regions of Nav1.5, which will allow us to address the controversy about whether and how Nav1.5 is regulated by Ca2+. These experiments will also provide insight into atomic structure and explain function of the critical C terminus (CT) and III-IV intracellular linker of Nav1.5. Further, we will illuminate molecular mechanisms of specific inherited arrhythmogenic mutations through these structural studies. In the second aim, we recognize that CaM is but one Ca2+ binding protein (CaBP) that regulates ion channel function; in vivo Ca2+-sensitivity of ion channel function might reflect a convergence of multiple CaBPs acting upon different channel determinants. We explore novel regulation of CaV1.2 Ca2+ channels by KChIP2, a CaBP previously shown to modulate K+ currents, but not yet reported to control Ca2+ channels. The third aim focuses on how Ca2+ regulates ion channels through the activation of Ca2+-sensitive effectors, such as kinases. Building upon our previous demonstration that CaMKII interacts with CaV1.2 Ca2+ channels to control Ca2+- dependent facilitation (CDF), we propose to explore the consequences of a molecular mimicry model to understand how CaMKII and the Ca2+ channel accessory 22a subunit interact to foster CDF. Together, results from these aims will define new means by which Ca2+ can feedback on multiple ion channels to regulate membrane excitability and show how dysregulation of these mechanisms is arrhythmogenic. Public Health Relevance: Ca2+ signaling is the final common pathway of electrical activity in the heart. Dysregulation of Ca2+ signaling contributes to cardiac arrhythmias. This proposal addresses how Ca2+ feeds back to regulate cardiac ion channels and examines the structure of critical domains in ion channels that are loci for inherited arrhythmogenic mutations.\n",

      "Foodborne illness associated with contamination fresh and processed food products are a major public health problem in the United States and internationally. Given the broad distribution of foods, particularly fresh produce, in the modern global food system, we increasingly are witnessing foodborne illness outbreaks that are very large with respect to numbers of cases and geographic distribution of cases. It is imperative for the food industry to implement more effective practices and systems to prevent and mitigate food safety hazards in fresh and processed food products. The preponderance of evidence indicates that effective education and training of food managers and front-line food workers, and implementing appropriate food safety behaviors and practices in the workplace, can prevent many foodborne illnesses. Relatively little research has been conducted to assess the impact of modern food safety systems, including those required by private food safety standards, to reduce food product contamination with microbial or chemical hazards and subsequently reduce the likelihood of foodborne illness in consumers of those products.This project will evaluate the efficacy of education and training of food managers and workers on implementation of appropriate food safety practices and behaviors. Knowledge will be assessed by assessment of training program participants. Practices will be assessed using survey instruments designed to evaluate production and processing practices by food producers and processors. Further, the incidence of selected food safety hazards and indicators of contamination will be assessed in products produced by participating firms. At the conclusion of this research, I expect to have identified production and processing practices most related to the incidence and levels of food safety hazards in selected fresh and processed food products. Further, this research will determine the potential efficacy of food safety training programs and management systems to control food safety hazards in these products.\n",

      "--------------------\n",
      "ï»¿   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Prevention of cognitive decline in old age ranks among the most important public health challenges. Identification of healthy cognitive aging has long been considered an essential step. However, despite decades of research, the profile of healthy cognitive aging remains unknown because pathologic processes that impair cognition often are present but not accounted for in studies of healthy cognitive aging. Most of the available studies have examined cognitive change in persons without dementia. However, many persons without cognitive impairment who come to autopsy have extensive neuropathologic evidence of common diseases known to cause cognitive impairment in old age (i.e., AD, CVD, and LBD). Moreover, recent data suggest that additional neuropathologies also are common in persons without dementia (e.g., TDP-43, hippocampal sclerosis, white matter disease). Further, most older persons exhibit a precipitous decline in cognition in the years just prior to death (i.e, terminal decline). Terminal decline represents a separate pathologic process that has not been accounted for in studies of healty cognitive aging. We propose a novel conceptualization of healthy cognitive aging as the cognitive change not accounted for by pathologic processes known to impair cognition in old age (i.e., neuropathologies and terminal cognitive decline). The overall goal of the proposed continuation is to identify the profile of healthy cognitive aging anddistinguish it from pathologic and terminal cognitive decline. Our research capitalizes on data from two ongoing studies of aging, the Religious Orders Study and the Memory and Aging Project, that collect the unique longitudinal cognitive and detailed post-mortem data required to identify healthy cognitive aging. We will first quantify the cognitive change due to neuropathologic and terminal cognitive decline (i.e., pathologic cognitive aging). Then, we will identify healthy cognitive aging (i.e., the residual cognitive change). Toward this end, the proposed study will employ a multimodal approach to quantify several new pathologic indices (i.e., neuropathologic indices of TDP- 43, hippocampal sclerosis, white matter disease, and multiple indices of brain integrity derived from neuroimaging) and use innovative analyses to examine their contribution to cognitive trajectories, above and beyond AD, CVD, and LBD. The proposed study offers a rare opportunity to identify the profile of healthy cognitive aging and distinguish it from neuropathologic and terminal cognitive decline. We are not aware of other studies that quantify essentially all of the pathologic processes known to impair cognition in old age as will be done here and in which similar analyses could be performed. The proposed study offers an innovative approach to address a fundamental and longstanding challenge in cognitive aging research. Knowledge of the trajectory of healthy cognitive aging is essential for the early identification of persons who will benefit most from effective intervention and, ultimately, for th prevention of cognitive decline in old age.\n",

      "Malaria is the most important vector-borne disease in Southeast Asia. Malaria control in this region faces a number of important challenges, including a lack of information on malaria incidence in remote impoverished areas, a lack of knowledge and viable methods to prevent malaria introduction from hyperdendemic countries to neighboring low-incidence countries, and a lack of effective, integrated control strategies. We strategically select study sites in China, Thailand and Myanmar that vary significantly in malaria endemicity. Malaria parasite introduction from Myanmar by human travelers, together with local transmission heterogeneity, represents the most difficult problem for malaria control in these countries. Therefore, the overarching objective of this project is to gain critical information on intra-country and inter-country malaria epidemiology for developing effective malaria control strategies in these countries. We design the following five specific aims: 1) to conduct malaria surveillance to determine clinical malaria incidence and sub-clinical infection rates in remote, impoverished border regions and other sentinel sites, and to examine inter-country transmission dynamics; 2) to study the molecular epidemiology of antimalarial drug resistance and the population genetic structure of Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax; 3) to identify malaria transmission foci at high spatial resolution and determine key environmental and biological determinants for transmission foci in the era of an intensive antimalarial campaign; 4) to examine immuno-epidemiology of P. falciparum and P. vivax infections using high-throughput protein microarrays, and 5) to develop integrated malaria management strategies and systematically evaluate the entomological and epidemiological impacts in multiple sites with distinct malaria epidemiology. This project lays important foundations for other projects of the ICEMR program, and will provide critical knowledge for developing and evaluating integrated malaria management strategies.\n",

      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are an abundant class of small non-coding RNAs that regulate diverse biological processes. Recent studies suggest that a cluster of miRNAs, the mir-17-92 polycistron located at 13q31, which contains seven miRNAs including miR-17-5p, miR-17-3p, miR-18a, miR-19a, miR-20a, miR-19b-1, and miR- 92-1, may function as an oncogene. These miRNAs are highly expressed in many malignant lymphomas and other neoplasms that contain amplified 13q31-32 chromosomal fragments. It has been demonstrated that enforced expression of the mir-17-92 cluster cooperated with c-myc expression to accelerate tumor development in a mouse model of human B-cell lymphoma, and that introduction of the expression construct of the mir-17-92 cluster could enhance lung cancer cell growth. However, it is unclear whether enforced expression of this miRNA cluster can induce cancer alone or must cooperate with other gene abnormalities. Moreover, the functional mechanisms through which the miRNAs contribute to the development of cancer are poorly understood. Recently, we observed that the miRNAs from this cluster are frequently overexpressed in various acute leukemias, particularly in MLL-rearrangement leukemia, although the degree of up-regulation varies between individual miRNAs. The overexpression of these miRNAs is usually correlated with the amplification of the miRNA cluster at its genomic locus. Thus, we hypothesize that the miRNAs from the mir- 17-92 cluster play a role in hematopoiesis, and that overexpression of the miRNAs may contribute to the development of leukemia alone and/or by cooperating with other abnormalities, e.g., MLL translocations. We also hypothesize that some of the miRNAs in the cluster may play a greater role than others in leukemogenesis. In addition, we hypothesize that overexpression of the miRNAs contributes to leukemogenesis by negatively regulating expression of their target genes, particularly those that are critical tumor suppressors. We propose to explore the role of each of the miRNAs and of the different combinations of these miRNAs in proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic progenitor cells, and in leukemogenesis by using two different mouse transplantation models. Finally, we have identified 21 highly likely target genes of the miRNAs from this cluster through our recent preliminary studies, and we will validate further the miRNA- target relationship and study the roles of the validated targets in the development of leukemia by using both in vitro and in vivo methods.\n",

      "ï»¿   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterized by social impairments and affects 1 in 68 US children, but remains poorly understood. Few biomarkers of ASD have been identified, hindering the understanding of its basic biology; nor are there any medications that treat the social deficits of ASD. Progress has been impeded by: 1) the difficulty of obtaining relevant tissue samples from patients and matched controls, and 2) in mouse models, the discordance between complex human behavior and laboratory-based mouse behavior, even with shared genetic etiologies. These two limitations underscore the tremendous value in developing an animal model of social deficits with more reliable behavioral and biological correlates to the human disease. Rhesus monkeys are an ideal model organism. Like humans, they are highly social, and both species display stable and pronounced individual differences in social functioning. At the behavioral extremes, low-social compared to high-social male rhesus monkeys initiate fewer affiliative interactions and display more inappropriate social behavior, suggesting both lower social motivation and poorer social skills. Naturally occurring low-social behavior in male rhesus monkeys therefore presents an exceptional opportunity to study the biology of social impairments. This research leverages a novel statistical classificationmodel which predicts, from infant behavior, subjects that are subsequently found to be low-social or high-social. On the basis of promising pilot data, we will collect quantitative social behavior data in a larger validation cohort of 1-5 year old male monkeys to confirm the discriminant power of this statistical model to be used as a robust high-throughput screening tool to rapidly identify social extremes in a large population. We will also test whether: our candidate biomarkers of social functioning (e.g., oxytocin and arginine-vasopressin; kinase signaling) correctly classify monkeys as low- social vs. high-social; the degree of biomarker dysregulation co-varies with the degree of social deficits; and cerebrospinal fluid and blood measures are equally informative. Because exclusion of females may impede identification of important disease mechanisms, we will also test, for the first time, whether our statistical classification model can be used to identify social extremes in female monkeys, and whether the same or different biomarkers predict social deficits in low-social females. Finally, we will createthe first primate social behavior test battery to better characterize the impairments of low-socialmonkeys with direct relevance to core autism symptoms (e.g., deficits in joint attention, face recognition, social learning, social competence, theory of mind, peer preferences). Creation of this battery will also allow us to test which biomarker measurements most robustly predict low-social monkey test performance to identify the most promising targets for therapeutic intervention. We are optimistic that further development of this model will accelerate the discovery of autism biomarkers and novel  druggable  targets, provide non-behavioral biometrics for treatment response, and streamline the development of the first effective autism therapeutics.\n",

      "--------------------\n",
      "ï»¿   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As a cofactor for thousands of enzymes, iron is an essential micronutrient. Yet, free iron is toxic because it catalyzes rapid formation of damaging reactive oxygen species. Therefore, homeostasis systems exert tight control on iron levels in all organisms and gene expression is adjusted in response to iron deprivation and iron abundance: expression of at least 100 genes is known to be iron-dependent in Escherichia coli. In humans, disruption of iron homeostasis contributes to severe diseases: iron accumulation in the brain is linked to neurodegenerative diseases, iron overload causes the liver disease hemochromatosis, and iron deficiency leads to anemia and impaired cognitive development. Furthermore, invading bacterial pathogens hijack iron out of human proteins to establish infections. These considerations underscore the essential role of iron homeostasis to human health. Because of a lack of studies examining the total cellular framework for the response to both iron deficiency and iron overload, however, how iron homeostasis is integrated into cell physiology is still unclear. Here, to address this deficiency, a two-pronged genome-wide approach is used consisting of: (1) ribosome profiling to determine how expression of genes changes over time in response to varying iron levels; and (2) genome-wide screens to identify genes that are important for survival under iron overload and iron deficiency. This approach is complemented by biochemical and genetic studies to mechanistically characterize new players in iron homeostasis. Importantly, two model systems will be investigated, the gram-negative bacterium Escherichia coli and human cells, allowing for an informative comparison of the two systems that will be essential to develop antibiotics specifically targeted at bacterial iron homeostasis. This comprehensive study will provide a time-resolved and holistic view of the response to iron and identify new players in iron homeostasis, including post-transcriptional regulators, transport systems to take up iron from different sources, and metabolic pathways that become activated in response to iron. Insight obtained from these experiments will benefit understanding of iron homeostasis diseases and treatment of bacterial infections.\n",

The focus is on outcomes in upper and lower airway, obesity, pre, peri and postnatal outcome, neurodevelopmental. Studies share data analysis center, The National Children's Study (NCS) is prospective longitudinal cohort study of the individual and combined effects of environmental exposures and gene environmental interactions on child health and development in a representative sample of approximately 100,000 children born in the United States. The children will be followed from before birth until age 21. The importance and timeliness of this study are based on many factors, including past experiences demonstrating profound effects of environmental exposures, such as exposures to alcohol during pregnancy and to lead in early childhood on child health and development; the special vulnerabilities of children to environmental exposures compared to adults; known ongoing exposures, such as prevalent levels of non-persistent pesticides or hours of media exposure per day in young children; and evidence for environmental contributions or causes to such high-impact conditions as autism, developmental delay and developmental disability, asthma, and obesity. The primary aim of the NCS is to investigate the separate and combined effects of environmental exposures (chemical, biological, physical, psychosocial) as well as gene-environment interactions on pregnancy outcomes, child health and development, and precursors of adult disease. Unique features of the study include its focus on environmental exposures at the earliest stages of pregnancy (as well as thereafter) and the breadth of planned exposure and outcome measurements. NICHD and a consortium of federal agencies plan and conduct a longitudinal study of the impacts of environmental exposures on children.  Because the focus of the study includes assessment of the impact of exposures that occur early in pregnancy, both pregnant women and their partners, and women of childbearing age, comprise the initial target population for enrollment. Data will be collected in combinations of face-to-face contacts and remote collection methods, e.g., telephone, computer, or mail-in questionnaires. The expected frequency of contact (face-to-face or remote) is approximately every three months through age one, every six months through age five years and annually thereafter. For a sample of children enrolled in the study, visits will also be made to child care and school settings for collection of environmental samples and observational data. Anticipated biologic specimens include blood, urine, hair, and nail clippings from mothers and children; blood, urine, and hair from fathers; cord blood, umbilical cord and placental tissues, and meconium collected at/around the time of delivery; vaginal swabs, and breast milk from mothers. Anticipated environmental samples include air, dust, soil, food, and water. .\n",

Little is known about the prevalence or correlates of ASD. Little high quality information is available regarding the phenotypic variation among individuals with ASD, prevalence of co-morbid conditions, and risk factors that might be related to the development of ASD. The Centers for Autism and Developmental Disabilities Research and Epidemiology (CADDRE) were established in 2001 to investigate causes and correlates of autism. The focus of this second funding cycle is to conduct a multi-site collaborative epidemiologic study to investigate risk and causal factors for ASD and phenotypic subgroups of ASD using a population-based case-cohort study design. Six sites (California, Maryland, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Colorado, and Georgia) will collaborate to enroll 2700 children and their families over the 5-year study period. Each site will include approximately 150 children with ASD, 150 with other neurodevelopmental disorders, and 150 general population controls to address specific hypotheses in six broad domains: 1) phenotypic variation in ASD, including the pattern of clustering of core symptoms, timing of onset, cognitive status, and presence of medical and psychiatric co-morbidities; 2) gastrointestinal features that may be associated with ASD, 3) candidate genes and genetic variation among individuals with ASD. and how they interact with environmental risk factors, 4) potential for parental infection, immune function, and autoimmunity to be associated with increased ASD risk, 5) potential for parental hormonal and reproductive characteristics to be associated with increased ASD risk, and 6) potential for sociodemographic and lifestyle factors to be associated with increased ASD risk. To address these goals, this study will conduct developmental assessments on the children and collect extensive data on the pre- and perinatal health and environment of the children and their parents via interviews, medical record review, and the collection of biologic samples. This large study of ASD will improve our understanding of how autism differs phenotypically from other disabilities and from typical development. It will also help identify potential risk factors for autism that deserve more attention.\n",

      "--------------------\n",
      "The p53 tumor suppressor is central to human DNA repair, damage checkpoints and many aspects of human biology. Importantly, most cancers are altered for p53 function. There is considerable variation in p53 dependent expression across >400 targeted genes leading to differences in p53-mediated biological consequences, due in part to variation in target response element (RE) sequence. We found that RE motifs differ considerably from the in vitro derived RE consensus target sequence previously described as 2 copies of RRRCWWGYYY separated by a spacer of up to 13 bases. We have focused on RE functionality, i.e., the ability of REs to support transactivation by p53. To directly assess functionality of human REs, i.e., transactivation responsiveness, we developed promoter systems in budding yeast for variable human p53 expression and have translated many of the findings to human cells in culture and ex vivo. That led us to the identification of super-transactivating sequences (STARES) that provide high transactivation at low p53 levels. Remarkably, we observed that transactivation specificity is conserved among p53 family proteins. We found that p53 can transactivate through noncanonical binding sequences including half-sites, greatly expanding the p53 regulatory network. We extended these studies genome-wide using ChIP-Seq analysis to identify p53 binding sites and associated gene expression changes following p53 activation in cancer cells as well as in primary T-lymphocytes after treatment with anti-cancer drugs. Similar to cancer cells, we found that most p53 bound sites contained a canonical p53 response element (2 tandem RRRCWWGYYY decamers without spacer). Importantly, we showed that p53 can also engage transcription using half-sites across the genome and we went on to define the minimal binding unit for p53-mediated transcription as a 1/2-site. Among differentially expressed genes associated with p53 binding several are relevant to immunity and inflammation. Moreover, in a global approach we are determining the p53 network by examining p53 binding across the genome, induced gene expression and protein interactors using mass spectrometry methods, under diverse stress conditions. We identified 45 novel p53 protein interactors in response to the commonly-used chemotherapeutic drug Doxorubicin. We found in our ChIPseq studies that p53 bound the transcriptional regulatory regions of 97% of these interactors, revealing potential regulatory p53 loops and thereby provide a novel systems biology approach to understanding the p53 stress responsive network.CANCER-ASSOCIATED p53 MUTANTS. With inclusion of immune response-related TLR genes into the p53 network, we evaluated the effect of 25 tumor-associated p53 mutants on TLR gene family expression after transient transfection in p53-null cancer cell. Changes in TLR transactivation patterns, including change-of-spectrum, were observed, suggesting that p53 tumor status might be an important factor in adjuvant therapy employing TLR pathways to treat cancer. Furthermore, we demonstrated that tumor-associated p53 mutants that induced expression of TLR3, enhanced cytokine and chemokine responses mediated by this receptor after exposing cells to TLR3 ligand poly-I:C alone or in presence of Doxorubicin. We also found that functional rescue of loss-of-function p53 mutants by the p53 reactivating drug RITA, restored TLR gene expression in a mutant p53 cell line and also enhanced DNA damage induced-apoptosis via TLR3 signaling. Furthermore, several p53 mutants also altered the expression of the innate immune related APOBEC3 (A3) gene family. In particular, overexpression of a group of tumor-associated p53 mutants in p53 null cancer cells actually promoted expression of A3B, which normally is repressed by WT p53, suggesting a clear gain of function phenotype for these p53 mutants. Since TP53 gene mutations occur in many human cancers, it is important to identify anticancer drugs that specifically target p53 mutant tumor cells. We are pursuing the identification of synthetic lethal (SL) genes with genome-wide siRNA-based screens, that when reduced in expression in p53 mutant cells cause death or reduced growth. The SLs are expected to lead to potential targets and provide opportunities for anticancer drug development. Using a human cancer colorectal cell line as a model, we have identified several SL targets for two of the most frequent tumor-associated p53 mutants (R175H and R273H) in the presence of anticancer drug etoposide as well as for the WT p53 and p53 null conditions. Among the SL genes identified, several are related to the DNA damage response including ATR, BRCA2, SOD1, TOP1, ZNF45. We have found that drug mediatied inhibition of etoposide p53SL target ATR, impacts Topoisomerase-mediated enzymatic activities. In addition, we developed another SL screen using genome wide sRNAi approach to identify synthetic enhancement of lethality genes that alter responses of p53 mutant cells to ionizing radiation. p53 NETWORK EVOLUTION. We are investigating evolution of REs in terms of responsiveness to p53. Individual REs exhibited marked differences in potential transactivation as well as widespread turnover of functional REs during p53 network evolution. We identified in our recent ChIPseq cancer cell study that 60% of the p53 REs were conserved at the sequence level in rodents. Around 120 potential human target genes associated with DNA metabolism were found to be bound by p53. Most of them can also interact directly with p53 protein.  Using a combination of gene expression/ transcriptomic and bioinformatic tools we have expanded the p53 transcriptome in DNA repair and nucleic acid metabolism transactions. We have validated the p53 transcriptional responsiveness of potential p53 DNA damage response target genes identified in our ChIPseq metanalysis under stressed and unstressed conditions using a Nanostring approach with various human cancer cells that vary in p53 functional status.THE INFLUENCE OF p53 ON HUMAN IMMUNE RESPONSES. We have established that p53 plays important physiologic roles in the immune system. p53 upregulates most members of TLR family in human primary and cancer cells to consequently enhance TLR-dependent production of proinflammatory cytokines in response to cognate ligands. We found that the transcriptional cofactor and pro-apoptotic regulator ASPP1 and ASPP2  can enhance p53 mediated transactivation of several TLR genes. We also found that p53 can collaborate with NFkappaB to strongly alter several immune/inflammatory responses in primary lymphocytes and macrophages from healthy volunteers. Accordingly, we generated a p53 ChIP-seq dataset associated with global gene expression from primary human lymphocytes under non-stress conditions as well as after ex-vivo treatment with well-known p53 activators (Doxorubicin and Nutlin. Around 200 genes that exhibited a p53/ligand synergistic response to chemotherapeutic agents have been identified. Among these genes we found several of the human cytidine deaminase A3 gene family involved in the innate immune that deal with retrotransposons and RNA virus infection are also subject to p53 transcriptional control by WT and mutant p53 in different directions. We observed that Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV), the of major cause of respiratory problems in young children worldwide, induced p53 protein activation, resulting in the expression of several A3 genes in a p53-dependent manner and influencing negatively the virus replication. A SNP in TLR8 regulatory region creates a p53 responsive sequence that renders responsiveness and transcriptional control of this gene by p53. We found that this SNP influences RSV disease severity in infants infected by this virus. Currently we are investigating the immune role that p53 might have during  HIV-1 infection.\n"

      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Continuation of the currently funded predoctoral and postdoctoral training program in the pharmacology and neuroscience of drug abuse is proposed. This five-year program will consist of funding for 3 predoctoral and 3 postdoctoral trainees per year. The program has already completed training 2 predoctoral students, and two are currently supported by this grant. Four postdoctoral trainees have been supported by this grant so far; one received an individual NRSA after one year of training, one completed the planned two years of training, and two are currently in training. Faculty participation is comprised of a) 15 training faculty who serve as mentors and who are either currently funded by NIDA or whose research programs can provide training relevant to drug abuse issues, and b) 5 resource faculty who contribute to the program via teaching and laboratory training. Approximately 27,500 square feet of laboratory space, a wide array of state-of-the art chemical, physiological and behavioral testing equipment, and approximately $3.5 million (direct) of federally sponsored research funds are designated annually for the research of the training faculty. The program for predoctoral trainees consists of a comprehensive neuropharmacology/neuroscience didactic curriculum which includes a course on the biology of addiction as well as related topics (e.g., effects of prenatal drug exposure, treatment of addiction) integrated into broader-based courses. Predoctoral trainees must complete research projects in three laboratories prior to choosing a mentor and developing a thesis project. Both predoctoral and postdoctoral trainees are required to attend an annual seminar program consisting of presentations by 20 invited speakers and all trainees must present a one hour research seminar annually as well. All trainees also are required to participate in a journal club course designed to teach them how to present effectively written research for publication and how to critique published literature. Training in ethical conduct of research is required of all trainees. The current and proposed program provides a multifaceted approach to understanding mechanisms of drug abuse and treatment through an integrated program of didactic work and an outstanding in-depth research experience. It is designed to train participants to become independent, ethical and skilled scientists able to make significant contributions in drug abuse research. Predoctoral training is expected to last 4-5 years; postdoctoral training duration is 2-3 years. All aspects of the program are administered by the director and an executive committee of administrative and training faculty.\n",

      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Project Summary: Research on efficacious adolescent substance abuse interventions over the past two decades has consistently demonstrated heterogeneity of response to treatment. Key challenges for the .field include understanding these various response trajectories and establishing strategies to adapt treatments to enhance their effectiveness for those who are not responsive to standard interventions. Such research is critically needed to inform treatment services providers on optimal care strategies. An important advance in treatment services research efforts is the increasing movement away from a  one-size-fits-all  perspective inherent in standardized interventions and a call for the development of adaptive interventions that incorporate treatment algorithms to aid clinical decision-making. The Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial (SMART) outlines a process whereby a series of randomizations within an individual study is used to create an optimal adaptive intervention. We propose two studies to examine the efficacy of eight potential adaptive treatment strategies using the SMART design. Study 1 goals are twofold (1) to examine which of two distinct sets of criteria for defining early treatment response (abstinence vs. minimal use) is the best guide for subsequent treatment decisions, i.e., how best to determine when response to a minimal treatment intervention is  good enough  for an adolescent to step out of treatment without risking a significant relapse. (2) to determine which of two stepped adaptive interventions result in better outcomes for treatment non-responders and relapsers: an enhanced version of the same treatment or a new treatment? Participants (n=80) will receive an initial dose of treatment consisting of MET/CBT8. At completion, participants will be randomly assigned, in sequential steps, to one of two treatment response criteria and, if needed, one of two stepped interventions. Pre- to post-treatment outcomes will be examined using the SMART protocol framework to identify the specific clinical components comprising the optimal adaptive treatment strategy in response to a particular treatment outcome. Study 2 is a pilot (n=60) test of the efficacy of the optimal adaptive strategy identified in Study 1 vs. a standard MET/CBT 12 group intervention, with follow up assessments at 3 and 6 months post-treatment. Relevance: This research will provide a systematic set of optimal decision rules for treatment agencies on how best to proceed when adolescents receiving an initial course of MET/CBT8 show initial treatment response, persist in their substance use, or demonstrate an initial treatment response followed by later relapse. This type of  practical  clinical trial begins the long overdue process of addressing critical gaps between traditional treatment efficacy research and key questions that emerge in clinical practice such as determining when adolescents have received sufficient treatment, how to proceed when initial treatment efforts are not effective, and how best to address relapse. Mechanisms of change will also be examined in Study 2.\n",

      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV dementia (HIV-D) and HIV-associated sensory neuropathy (HIV-SN) are the most common neurological manifestations of advanced HIV infection. The prevalence of HIV-D and HIV-SN in Sub- Saharan Africa where the majority of HIV cases reside globally is largely unknown. In addition, HIV subtype may have an impact on HIV disease progression, suggesting the possibility that HIV subtypes may differ with respect to their ability to cause neurological disease. The project will assemble a cohort of HIV+ individuals in Uganda: 1) to determine the prevalence of and risk factors associated with HIV-D and HIV-SN among untreated HIV+ individuals with moderate advanced immunosuppression, 2) to determine whether untreated HIV+ individuals decline from baseline in neuropsychological test performance, and peripheral nerve function, and 3) to obtain preliminary data to determine whether HIV subtypes differ with respect to the risk of HIV-D and HIV-SN, and progression of HIV-associated cognitive impairment and peripheral nerve function. We propose one of the first large scale prospective studies of HIV-D and HIV-SN in Sub-Saharan Africa. This proposal will provide the data necessary to characterize the prevalence and progression of HIV-D and HIV-SN, which could be used for future R01 applications. HIV-associated cognitive impairment is currently not an indication for HAART initiation in HIV+ individuals with a CD4 count in the 201-350 cells/Â¿L range. Our proposal will provide the data necessary to determine if clinical practice parameters for the initiation of HAART among HIV+ individuals with moderate immunosuppression and mild neurocognitive impairment should be changed in countries within Sub-Saharan Africa such as Uganda. Our proposal will examine whether HIV subtypes may differ with respect to their ability to cause HIVassociated CNS and PNS dysfunction. The proposal will also provide training for the HIV clinician-scientists in Kampala, Uganda in research studies of HIV-associated neurological disease. Based upon our preliminary data, we believe that HIV-D and HIV-SN are frequently unrecognized complications of advanced HIV infection in Sub-Saharan Africa, and are a significant cause of morbidity in HIV+ individuals in Uganda, which if identified early, can be treated effectively with antiretroviral therapy and symptomatic therapies.     PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The epidemiology of HIV dementia (HIV-D) and HIV-associated sensory neuropathy (HIV-SN) in Sub-Saharan Africa where the majority of HIV cases reside globally is largely unknown.

      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): My goal for the K25 award is to establish myself as an independent neuroimaging researcher with expertise in brain network analysis and an integral member of multidisciplinary research teams devoted to addressing diseases of the brain. Attaining these objectives will require focused didactic training and research guidance. Research We will develop new methodology to improve whole-brain connectivity analyses of normal and abnormal brain function. The launching of the Human Connectome Project by the NIH in 2009 underscores the importance of whole-brain connectivity analyses. Appropriately conducting these analyses is paramount in our understanding normal brain function as well as alterations due to conditions such as aging, dyslexia, and substance abuse. Before we can glean useful information from functional brain network differences in these conditions, methods need to be developed in order to permit 1) assessing several network properties simultaneously while also accounting for the complex dependence structure of the networks; 2) making predictions about the presence and strength (weight) of connections between brain regions based on disease status; 3) determining whether task related changes in brain networks are associated with clinical outcomes. The novel methods proposed here will address these needs, providing more appropriate techniques for the emerging area of whole-brain connectivity analysis. This research, along with my proposed training experiences and strong mentoring team, will facilitate my progression toward becoming an independent neuroimaging researcher with expertise in brain network analysis and enable me to make unique contributions to brain research. Training The proposed training plan consists of four elements: 1) a didactic component aimed at establishing a basic foundation in computational neuroscience and image analysis; 2) career guidance in methodological development and collaborative neuroimaging research through planned on and off-site mentoring by neuroscientists and network and neuroimaging statisticians; 3) conducting innovative research utilizing the gained neuroscientific and image analytic knowledge and previous statistical training; and 4) participating in the exchange of ideas in statistics and the neurosciences through conference and workshop attendance. The planned training activities will focus on deepening my understanding of the brain as a complex system, enabling me to reasonably model and evaluate this system within its biological context. The combination of my knowledge in network-based brain imaging statistics, computational neuroscience, and image analysis will be a valuable asset that will not be confined to a single brain disorder. While the data analyses proposed here will focus on aging and brain degeneration, dyslexia, and substance abuse, the skills and knowledge that I will gain will position me to collaborate with investigators that study a broad range of clinical brain disorders.\n",

      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The overall objective of the NIDA Training Program in Drug Abuse Research at The University of Chicago is to provide both pre- and postdoctoral trainees with comprehensive educational and research experiences that will enable them to pursue distinguished research careers in areas impacting drug abuse. Drug abuse poses a serious threat to the health and well being of both individuals and society. Mental status, physical health, social function and economic productivity are compromised. Such factors can lead to an increase in crime and violence. To the credit of NIDA-sponsored research programs, considerable gains have been made over the last two decades. However, much more remains to be learned from the molecular to the social realm, especially if knowledge is to be translated into effective treatment. Existing programs in the area of drug abuse at The University of Chicago are designed to acquire knowledge about the social, behavioral, neuropharmacological, molecular and genetic factors relevant to the abuse of drugs. The aim is to increase our understanding of the etiology of and our ability to intervene in the treatment and prevention of drug abuse. Specific strengths of this program relate to the neuropharmacology, psychopharmacology, electrophysiology, genetics and molecular biology of drug abuse as well as the behavioral and subjective effects of drugs in humans. Several factors place the faculty submitting this application in an excellent position to continue to offer an outstanding training program. These factors include the strength of current interests and ongoing research into the problems of drug abuse, the diversity of approaches employed by individual faculty, the presence of a critical mass of creative scientists working on drug abuse related problems in a multidisciplinary setting as well as a curriculum that addresses the broad aspects of drug abuse ranging from the molecular bases of drug action to the consideration of ethical and social issues related to drug taking.\n",

      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Older adults are at increased risk to develop prolonged pain and experience greater pain-related loss of physical and psychosocial function compared to younger cohorts. We propose that changes in endogenous pain modulatory capacity accounts for increased incidence of pain and disability in older adults. That endogenous pain modulation dysfunction is related to persistent pain is supported by a number of studies comparing chronic pain patients with healthy controls using a  pain-inhibition-by-pain  experimental model. Although this research group (and others) has shown age deficiencies using the  pain inhibits pain  model, other human laboratory models that are known to engage pain modulatory systems have not been tested across the lifespan, each potentially involving different mechanisms. The overarching goal of the proposed research is to characterize age-related changes in pain inhibitory and facilitatory function and to investigate the biopsychosocial mediators and clinical relevance of these changes. Our preliminary data suggest that sophisticated psychophysical methods reflecting net inhibitory or facilitatory effects are sensitive to changes across the lifespan and will provide a more comprehensive and clinically-relevant picture of changes in pain processing associated with aging. This proposed study will enroll 180 human subjects, ages 18-79, who will undergo assessment during three pain modulatory sessions at baseline. The pain modulatory tests will include inhibitory protocols; diffuse noxious controls and offset analgesia, and tests that involve pain facilitation; temporal summation, impaired decay of subthreshold pain (proxy for central sensitization), and a prolonged protocol which we have found produces greater temporal sensitization across repeated trials in older subjects. Individualized temperatures for the contact heat test stimulus will be used so that subjects experience similar, moderate levels of pain. We hypothesize that age will be associated with poorer endogenous pain inhibition from pain inhibitory protocols and increased pain from protocols that facilitate pain. A range of biopsychosocial markers will be measured that we hypothesize will mediate the association between age and variability in pain modulation. These measures include psychosocial factors (catastrophizing, sleep, stress, and negative emotions) and biological markers (blood pressure, 2-endorphin, cortisol, and other hypothalamic-pituitary- adrenal and immune markers). After establishing individual levels of pain facilitation and pain inhibition, we will assess pain during daily life and the impact of pain on quality of life using a series of telephone interviews and novel real-time electronic data capture each month for 6 months. We expect that changes in our pain modulatory tests will account for observed age differences in pain frequency, more pain intensity, number of pain sites, and in quality of life.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Older persons are at greater risk of developing prolonged pain, and when they do, they suffer a greater impact of pain on quality of life than younger persons. This study will employ cutting-edge pain testing techniques to test for changes in pain inhibitory capacity, which we hypothesize contribute to increased incidence of pain and disability in older adults. As a public health problem, the increase in numbers of elders expected in our nation's population in the coming decades render understand the mechanism behind increased pain among older adults a compelling area for research\n",

      "Lymphocyte numbers are regulated both by responses to conventional exogenous antigens and endogenous microflora, by stimulation by self-peptide/MHC complexes and by the action of a series of cytokines. This multifaceted regulation permits individuals to maintain a broad repertoire of lymphocytes of distinctive specificities, allowing responses against a vast array of foreign substances and, at the same time, providing a pattern of memory based on the immunization history of the individual. The study of the process of lymphocyte dynamics that underlies this regulation requires a multidisciplinary approach, aimed both at the molecular underpinnings of the processes through which lymphocytes survive and proliferate and a systems/ computational biology approach to appreciate the overall mechanisms governing total numbers of lymphocytes of distinct phenotype and distinct specificity. Emphasis has been placed on four aspects of this problem: the priming, expansion and differentiated phenotype of naive CD4 T cells in response to antigen challenge, the dynamics of lymphocyte memory and of memory phenotype cells, the mechanisms underlying CD4 T cell depletion in HIV infection, and the process of homeostatic proliferation and death. In an effort to develop strategies to enhance response of nave and memory cells to their cognate antigens, it was observed that the most potent stimulant of such expansion was the cytokine IL-1. When expansion of CD4 TCR transgenic T cells in a syngeneic host in response to antigen was measured, it was found that administering IL-1 over a 3 to 5 day period caused a ten-fold or greater enhancement in the degree of expansion when compared to that seen using conventional adjuvants such as LPS. This was equally true for naive and memory cells and was not mediated by other cytokines. The use of recipients that were IL-1 receptor knockouts and IL-1 receptor-sufficient donors of TCR transgenic T cells showed that IL-1 could act directly on the responding CD4 or CD8 T cells to mediate expansion. IL-1 receptor antagonist diminished the adjuvant effect of LPS indicating that a substantial portion of the effect of this conventional adjuvant was due to endogenous production of IL-1. The very robust effect of IL-1 suggests it may have a role in certain immunization strategies.IL-1 acts directly on CD4 T cells to enhance their differentiation into IL-17 producing cells.  However, although IL-1 acts directly on CD8 cells to mediate their expansion, differentiation of CD8 into efficient cytotoxic cells requires the action of IL-1 on non-T cells. IL-1 strikingly enhances the frequency of effector/memory CD8 T cells that migrate into peripheral tissues such as lung and liver.  Such migration requires expression of IL-1R1 on a cell other than the responding T cells. Strikingly, the effects of IL-1 during priming are retained at the time of secondary challenge even though IL-1 is not administered again.  Thus, the secondary response in mice primed in the presence of IL-1 includes increased in numbers of antigen-specific effector CD8 T cells, a greater presence in the tissues, and the expression of large amounts of granzyme B. Unexpectedly, IL-1-driven granzyme B induction of CD8 T cells is primarily mediated by vascular endothelial cells, a conclusion that was supported by co-culture experiments showing that IL-1 signals HUVEC cells, which in turn increase the number of granzyme B+ CD8 T cells. These findings suggest that expansion and effector differentiation of CD8 T cells are differentially regulated by IL-1. Moreover, preliminary experiments also showed that IL-1 administration increases the antitumor activity of CD8 T cells against B16 melanoma cells. Memory CD4 T cell proliferation was shown to be quite slow.  Specific T cells from mice infected with LCMV divide at a rate of <2% per day.  By contrast CD44bright CD25- CD4 T cells divide much more rapidly, at 8 to 10% per day.  This rapid steady state proliferation of  memory phenotype  CD4 T cells is similar in conventional and germfree mice. Analysis of the repertoire of memory phenotype undergoing proliferation revealed no difference in receptor complexity from that of non-dividing memory phenotype cells.  This implies that division is largely stochastic and probably dominantly driven by cytokines or other endogenous ligands rather than by peptide/ MHC complexes, whether of exogenous or endogenous origin. An important question is the role these cells might play in host defense. Is their generation and development into effector cells an irrelevant consequence of how the immune system has evolved or do these cells contribute to pathogen resistance by providing a form of innate-like immunity?  Recent studies suggest that the latter is the case.Memory phenotype and authentic memory cells differ from one another not only in their proliferative rates but, based on an RNA-SEQ analysis, also on the expression of NUR77, the latter being highly expressed on authentic memory cells even 30 days after priming, when they are already quiescent.  Interestingly, in neonatal mice, the memory phenotype pool is efficiently colonized and preliminary results suggest that after 2 weeks of age, thymic emigrants enter the pool very inefficiently.  We suspect then that the memory phenotype pool represents a set of self-specific cells generated early in the life of the individual and capable of producing Th1, Th2 or Th17 type cytokines early in infections as a results of stimulation of these cells through key cytokines, self-peptide MHC complexes or a combination of the two.  In a sense, these cells are adaptive Th cells with a potent innate functionalityCD4+ T cells are composed of nave, pathogen-specific memory, and pathogen-independent memory-phenotype (MP) cells. Nave and pathogen-specific memory cells play key roles in adaptive immune responses to primary and secondary infections, respectively. By contrast, MP cells are known to develop independently of foreign antigens but the homeostatic mechanisms regulating their generation and maintenance as well as their biological functions are unclear.Previously we had shown that MP cells are generated from nave cells not only in lymphopenic but also in lymphoreplete environments, dependently of TCR signaling induced by available pMHC ligands including self antigens and CD28 signaling. Once generated, these MP cells became less dependent upon TCR signaling but still required CD28 for their proliferation. Interestingly, these MP cells seemed to have innate-like function; they produced IFN- at a very early time point of Toxoplasma infection (as early as day 2 post infection).To address the mechanisms of this innate-like function, in this year we examined the IFN- production by MP cells in more details. We firstly confirmed that MP cells but not Ag-specific effector cells derived from nave cells produce IFN- even when TCR signaling is blocked by Y3P antibody or cyclosporine A during infection. This IFN- production was almost exclusively seen in T-bet hi but not in T-bet lo MP cells, was dependent upon IL-12 and further promoted by IL-18. Furthermore, MP cells could significantly prolong survival of T. gondii-infected Rag c KO mice, especially in the presence of IL-12, suggesting the biological importance of this innate-like cell population.Further investigation will establish how MP cells exert their function in the periphery, which may lead to development of novel therapeutic strategy toward Th1-related infectious and inflammatory diseases.\n",

      "--------------------\n",
      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adolescent substance use is common and associated with both significant negative individual consequences and substantial costs to society. The proposed study will capitalize on a cost-effective opportunity to identify neurobiological mechanisms underlying risks for, and consequences of, adolescent substance use. Tests will be conducted in adolescents with high (n= 68) and low (n = 34) familial risk for substance use disorders, selected from a larger ongoing longitudinal study that is testing causal relationships between the development of impulse control and substance use. In this new application, we seek to identify relationships between maturation of frontostriatal circuitry, impulse control development, and progression of substance use involvement across adolescence. We propose to measure frontostriatal circuitry in 11- to 14- year-old adolescents at risk for substance use disorders and to repeat assessments annually for a 5-year period. We will compare circuitry between adolescents at high or low risk for substance use disorders (based on family history) before regular drug use begins (Aim 1); determine how individual differences in early adolescent frontostriatal circuitry development, before regular drug use, predict onset and severity of substance use (Aim 2); and examine how trajectories of frontostriatal circuitry development are affected by both familial risk and adolescent substance use (Aim 3). This application posits that a) impulsive reward- focused behaviors emerging during adolescence are driven, at least in part, by inadequate regulation of the striatum due to delayed maturation of the prefrontal cortex, and b) that adolescents are uniquely vulnerable to substance use disorders and resultant cognitive impairments. This framework allows for testable hypotheses to examine neurobiological mechanisms underlying relationships observed between impulse control and substance use disorders across adolescent development. This is an opportunity to study the etiology of adolescent substance use by examining neurobiological mechanisms underlying risk for substance use disorders, impulse control development, and effects of substance use on adolescent brain development. Our study has the unique advantage of recruiting from an established and well-characterized cohort that is being followed longitudinally. A strong interdisciplinary research team is in place which combines unique expertise in substance abuse research, advanced imaging methodology, adolescent behavioral assessment, and statistical modeling. This proposal integrates distinct bodies of research on brain development, adolescent behavior, and substance abuse to advance understanding of risks and consequences of adolescent substance use.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposal integrates distinct bodies of research on brain development, adolescent behavior, and substance abuse to advance understanding of risks and consequences of adolescent substance use. This work has important implications for advancing knowledge, and ultimately may contribute to more effective treatment and prevention strategies for adolescent substance use disorders.\n",

      "cognitive schizophrenia deficits measures control psychosis pfc prefrontal symptoms functional\n",
      "--------------------\n",
      "ï»¿   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cognitive deficits are an intrinsic part of schizophrenia, occurring independently of positive symptoms, and often persisting even when psychotic symptoms of schizophrenia have been successfully treated. Cognitive functioning is moderately to severely impaired in patients with schizophrenia and is typically present even in the prodromal phase of the disorder, in young drug-naÃ¯ve patients. The deficits are in the domain of executive function largely controlled by the prefrontal cortex (PFC). However, there is only a fragmentary understanding of biochemical dysfunctions in brain that leads to cognitive impairment in schizophrenia. Furthermore, even though atypical antipsychotic drugs can improve certain aspects of cognition, many patients do not achieve remission. Therefore, the development of new therapeutic drugs for cognitive impairment remains imperative. However, the design of new agents for treating cognitive deficits in schizophrenia is hampered by not knowing how the more successful antipsychotic drugs exert their benefit on cognitive function.  The goals of the application are to understand the biochemical and synaptic changes in PFC that underlie schizophrenia-like cognitive deficits and identify the beneficial alterations produce by drugs that have demonstrated efficacy in combating these symptoms. These goals will be addressed using non-human primate models that have face, construct and predictive validity for the cognitive deficits of schizophrenia, together with the sex bias that characterizes the risk forschizophrenia. Our hypothesis is that dopamine, brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and estradiol are important factors that interact in the PFC to modify excitatory spine synapses on dendrites of pyramidal neurons, which in turn critically modulates executive function.  This project will use a novel developmental phencyclidine (PCP) model and an adult primate PCP model that have resonance to the dopamine, glutamate and GABA hypotheses of schizophrenia, in addition to being relevant to the theories of developmental origins for the illness. The application has 3 specific aims: 1) Identify to what extent estradiol contributes to resilience of the peri-adolescent monkey PFC to the detrimental biochemical, synaptic and cognitive effects of PCP, 2) Identify the potential of local over-expression of BDNF to initiate recovery of excitatory spine synapses from the impact of PCP on primate PFC, and 3) Identify biochemical, synaptic and cognitive consequences of acute and repeated novel atypical antipsychotic drug administration in PFC of PCP-exposed monkeys.  This current project contains refinement of previous theoretical concepts and approaches, and tests the impact of new interventions, utilizing improvements in current methodology. This work is expected to lead to new strategies in treating cognitive deficits in schizophrenia, which is the prime driver of significant disabilities in occupational, social, and economic functioning in patients, and imposesa heavy emotional burden on the family and an economic toll on the healthcare system.\n",

      "inflammatory inflammation macrophages immune pro anti macrophage cytokines sepsis activation\n",
      "--------------------\n",
      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Atherosclerosis is the leading cause of death in the United States and is now widely recognized as a chronic inflammatory disease occurring within the artery wall. The macrophage is the key innate immune cell type implicated in atherogenic inflammation, a pathophysiology largely driven by alterations in transcription. Work over the past two decades has identified pathways initiated through cell surface toll-like and cytokine receptors which culminate in the activation of NF-kB, AP1, and Stat proteins and subsequent transcriptional activation of pro-inflammatory genes encoding cytokines, chemokines, and matrix remodeling enzymes. The means and mechanisms by which pro-inflammatory genes are attenuated, however, remain poorly understood. Peroxisome proliferator activated receptors (PPARs) are lipid-sensing nuclear receptors and represent a nexus between nutrition, metabolism, and inflammation. Importantly, two PPAR isotypes are expressed in macrophages, PPARg and PPARd, and synthetic activators of each of these receptors are anti-inflammatory and anti-atherosclerotic in mouse models. Little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying these therapeutic effects, but existing data suggest that interactions with the represser proteins NCoR and BCL6 may be central to their anti-inflammatory actions. A central hypothesis of this proposal is that inflammation can be modulated at the transcriptional level by PPARs and their repressors. We will elucidate roles for three components of the PPAR repressor complex, including BCL6, SMRT, and NCoR in macrophage- elicited inflammation, atherogenesis, and PPAR anti-inflammatory control. Experiments will take advantage of unique mouse knockout, knock-in, and knock-down models and utilize biochemical, molecular, and physiologic approaches. RELEVANCE (See instructions): These studies will further our understanding of inflammation and atherosclerosis, focusing on the mechanisms by which PPARd exerts its anti-inflammatory effects. Insights from this work may identify targets for new types of anti-inflammatory drugs or next-generation PPAR compounds designed to improve the treatment of atherosclerosis and other inflammatory diseases.\n",

      "--------------------\n",
      "Crucial components of environmental data analysis are exposure assessment and the relationship between exposure and a health outcome. Investigators often go to great lengths to obtain careful, detailed measures of exposure, which may have multiple constituents, change over time, and be modified by personal factors. Investigators often replace this multivariate exposure data with simple summary statistics (e.g., cumulative or average exposures in some time window of interest) for analysis, which may or may not be the aspects of exposure most closely related to health outcomes of interest. Indeed, to assess the association between an individual&rsquo;s exposure history and a health event, it is preferable (and often necessary) to reduce the dimensionality of the exposure history data to calculate aggregate and cumulative exposure effects. Some examples include exposure to drinking water disinfection by-products (DBPs), occupational exposures to agricultural chemicals, and exposures to air pollutants. The primary objectives of this research are to develop useful methods for summarizing complex exposures and for examining the relationship between the exposures and health outcomes, to account properly for resultant uncertainty in the exposure assessment, and to use the models for estimation, prediction, and other inferences about the effects of multi-chemical, multi-pathway exposures.\n",

      "alcohol drinking alcoholism dependence consumption use aud binge abuse heavy\n",
      "--------------------\n",
      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Learned associations between alcohol and the people, places and paraphernalia (cues) surrounding alcohol drinking represent a major barrier to the successful treatment of alcohol dependence; these associations are remarkably persistent, despite efforts to extinguish them, and can trigger alcohol craving and relapse even after long periods of abstinence. Thus, associations between alcohol and alcohol cues constitute a unique target for treatment but there is little clinical evidence of how the associations are formed, and limited empirical support for a direct effect of cues on alcohol consumption. The long-term goal of this research is to understand how alcohol cues become powerfully linked with alcohol drinking, their influences on physiology and behavior, and how they promote alcohol consumption and alcohol dependence. The objective of the proposed research project is to determine how associations between alcohol and the places where it is consumed influence ad lib drinking and the behavioral processes underlying the causal link using a de novo conditioning model in heavy drinkers. This novel model, developed in the applicants' laboratory, is particularly well-suited to studying conditioned alcohol associations because exposure to alcohol and alcohol-paired environments can be carefully controlled allowing a comprehensive analysis of the results. The working hypothesis is that alcohol conditioned cues (contexts) alter behavior and subjective responses to alcohol which mediate an increase in drinking. The rationale for the project is that vital knowledge regarding conditioned responses to alcohol contexts will lead to novel strategies to counteract responses to conditioned alcohol cues, their influence on behavior, and alcohol drinking. The hypothesis, based upon strong preliminary data from the applicants' laboratory, will be tested by three specific aims: 1) Identify mood, behavior and subjective responses to alcohol in the alcohol-paired context, 2) Assess ad lib alcohol drinking in the alcohol-paired context and determine how it is related to mood, behavior and subjective responses to alcohol, and 3) Determine how individual differences in alcohol subjective response influence the development of conditioned associations between alcohol and contexts. We believe that the proposed plan of research is innovative because it will examine how conditioned associations between alcohol and contexts are formed in humans, the influence of the conditioned associations on mood and behavior, and their direct effect on alcohol consumption. This research project is significant because it will advance and expand understanding of how conditioned associations between alcohol and cues are acquired and of their influences on alcohol reward, wanting and consumption. Ultimately this knowledge is expected to inform the development of novel strategies and pharmacotherapies to counteract responses to the conditioned cues in effective treatment approaches.\n",

      "ethanol withdrawal drinking chronic nac synaptic glutamate consumption etoh vta\n",
      "--------------------\n",
      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The mechanisms that underlie the development and maintenance of ethanol self-administration are not fully understood, but the involvement of dopamine in the mesolimbic system has been hypothesized for some time. It is clear that ethanol administration stimulates dopamine release in this system, but the role of dopamine in ethanol self-administration behavior during various phases of exposure to ethanol is unclear. Previous studies funded by this grant show that dopamine activity undergoes plasticity during the earliest period of development of the reinforcing properties of ethanol. A transient increase in accumbal dopamine occurs during consumption of ethanol after a few days of exposure to ethanol, but not during an initial exposure. This transient increase in dopamine is correlated with exposure to the stimulus properties of ethanol rather than the brain concentration of ethanol. This suggests that the dopamine signal is playing a physiological role that predicts the rewarding effects of ethanol that will be experienced as the brain ethanol concentrations rise. Therefore, we hypothesize that the dopamine activity contributes to the development of the self-administration behavior. If so, inhibiting the dopamine signal with pharmacological antagonists in the nucleus accumbens should inhibit or retard the acquisition of ethanol self-administration behavior. We propose to test this in aim 1 by measuring the rate of acquisition of ethanol self-administration in the presence of selective antagonists of dopamine D1/D5, D2, and D3 receptors that will be microinjected into the nucleus accumbens. The second and third aims will focus on the potential mechanism for maintenance of ethanol self-administration behavior. Long term self- administration may lead to a habit-like intake of ethanol which may result from recruitment of neural circuits in the dorsal striatum. Aim 2 will directly test the hypothesis that habitual intake of ethanol occurs after long term training. This will be done by using a devaluation procedure to produce an aversive state after ethanol administration, and then testing whether ethanol-seeking behavior is maintained under this new condition. Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that dopamine in the dorsal striatum is released during ethanol consumption after the development of reliable ethanol self-administration. Aim 4 will test the hypothesis that blockade of dopamine receptors in the dorsal striatum will inhibit habitual ethanol consumption. Together the experiments proposed will provide new data on the role of dopamine in the various stages of the development o ethanol reinforcement in a behaviorally relevant context. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE The proposed studies on alcohol drinking behavior are highly relevant to humans. A significant proportion of U.S. citizens suffer from the deleterious effects of excessive alcohol drinking, and this leads to tremendous suffering of their families as well as society. Therefore, understanding the effects of alcohol on basic brain function and behavior and the underlying mechanisms in a rat model can provide information about public policy, prevention, and medical interventions in humans.\n",

      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hunter College proposes to continue, expand and improve its 27year old (1981) MBRS supported RISE program which has produced approximately 66 PhDs (38 in progress) from students who are underrepresented in science. In this Revision, we seek a supplement to support our Graduate Student Training program. In the competitive renewal of this grant (submitted May 2007), only the Undergraduate Research Training Program was supported. At both the undergraduate and graduate level, students who are underrepresented in science receive an intensive research experience in a laboratory engaged in nationally funded, competitive, state of the art, biomedical science research. At the undergraduate level (10 supported students), it also involves intensive mentoring by a faculty member and other enrichment activities intended to enhance science performance and to inspire and motivate students to seek advanced degrees in science (PhD) and a research career. Undergraduate students also attend extramural summer research programs either at many sites in the USA. At the graduate level (12 PhD and 2 MS supported students), it also provides an environment which promotes the achievement of a PhD and entry into future science careers. Graduate students attend the twice monthly Graduate Student Forum where topics include professional development guidance, research guidance, enhancement of communication skills (oral and written) and talks by scientists from academia and government and by former graduates of the program. These sessions are held at Hunter College and at the Graduate and University Center of the City University of New York (CUNY). In addition, workshops on similar and other topics are provided by CUNY Graduate Center and Hunter College. A Physics Prep Course, sponsored by RISE and CUNY Graduate Center, provides tutoring and problem solving for courses and for the Physics Qualifying Exam in order to increase the number of URM and non-URM Physics PhD students. The MBRS RISE goal is to increase the numbers of underrepresented minority students engaged in biomedical and behavioral research, and to broaden the opportunities for underrepresented minority students to participate in biomedical and behavioral research. A number of specific objectives to meet this goal are detailed in the specific aims and evaluation plan for both undergraduate and graduate students. These were based on outcome measures for RISE and non-RISE students at Hunter College. The most important aims for graduate students include maintaining graduation rates of 90% for PhD and 75% for MS students. 90% of students will enter post doctoral positions. The time for passing qualifying examinations and receiving PhDs of RISE students will be decreased to match rates of non-RISE students. The number of student publications will be increased to the rate of non-RISE students (3/student). Finally, 3.5 students/year will receive PhDs. The addition of the Graduate program to the current RISE grant will expand the College's tradition of graduating large numbers of minority students who become graduate students, receive PhDs, enter post doctoral fellowships and become faculty members engaged in science research at colleges and universities in NYC and elsewhere in the USA.     Public Health Relevance Statement: Graduate students enrolled in Ph.D. programs will receive research training in biomedical areas. Thus, this program will educate and train the next generation of scientists who engage in research to benefit public health.\n",

      "--------------------\n",
      "The goal of the laboratory is to develop new approaches to the study of the genetic basis of cancer and its outcomes. Previously, the major focus was the analysis of common genetic variation in candidate genes in cancer and its related outcomes, particularly in immunocompromised individuals. Emphasis was on conducting pilot association studies and annotating candidate genes drawn from key pathways in innate immunity and cancer biology, such as telomere stability or nutrient transport (i.e., Vitamin C sodium dependent transport). The laboratory has developed expertise in bio-informatics and advanced genetic analyses with new platforms designed to test dense sets of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), which are the most common genetic variants in the human genome. Specifically, the laboratory has integrated approaches to identify and validate common SNPs and ancestral haplotypes, which could be used to dissect the genetic basis of disease susceptibility.  The laboratory utilizes programs and approaches in population genetics, epidemiology and molecular evolution, which assist in the choice and analysis of genetic variants under study. The same strategy has also been extended to pilot studies in solid tumors, such as osteogenic sarcoma, colorectal and prostate cancer. In addition, the laboratory has initiated study of the genetic events underlying development of Ewings Sarcoma. A population genetics approach has been employed to examine the possible contribution of genomic variation in the EWSR1 region and also to look at genetic variants on distant chromosomes that could increase or decrease risk for Ewings Sarcoma.  Recently, the focus of the laboratory has shifted to dissect the genetic basis of SNP markers validated in large scale, genome-wide association studies (GWAS). This new approach can identify new regions to be studied in great detail and eventually applied to large molecular epidemiology studies to estimate the magnitude of the effect. It will also be possible to investigate the interaction between genes and environmental factors. Moreover, these markers may identify potential genotypic differences that could bear important predictive value for disease as well as highlight potential pathways related to both disease etiology and perhaps therapeutic intervention. We have developed a series of collaborations with leading epidemiologists and bio-statisticians in the Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG). Collaborative efforts have resulted in the development of new approaches to assess the false positive report probability (FPRP), a new tool intended to better assess the robustness of findings in genetic association studies. Lastly, the long-term goals of the laboratory are to identify and characterize genetic variants that could be used as prospective tools for early detection and intervention. the studies currently underway are directed at elucidating the biological basis of the susceptibility of risk alleles. At the same time, the current strategy continues to highlight genetic variants in key pathways in cancer susceptibility and outcome.  In addition, the laboratory is closely related to the NCI Core Genotyping Facility of the NCI. The availability of high throughput sequence and genotype expertise is critical for conducting pilot studies as well as sufficiently powered, well-designed studies in molecular epidemiology and pharmacogenomics. Adaptation and integration of new informatic tools, such as Genewindow and ht-SNP selection have also been implemented.  The laboratory has focused on a series of follow-up steps based on the results of the Cancer Genetic Markers of Susceptibility genome wide association studies of prostate and breast cancer. After extensive replication studies established strong statistical significance, the laboratory has begun to study the new loci, mapping the common and uncommon genetic variants in order to nominate suitable variants for functional studies, designed to provide plausibility to strong association signals. The laboratory will conduct a series of genetic analyses designed to dissect the genetic variants associated with disease risk also discovered in GWAS of other cancers, such pancreatic, bladder and lung cancers. These studies will include deep re-sequencing to develop a comprehensive catalogue of variants necessary to generate detailed haplotypes for subsequent genotyping large case controls. In turn, functional studies will be conducted to investigate the biological basis of the contribution of genetic variants to disease susceptibility. Collaboration with other laboratories will be sought to investigate the association between germ-line genetic variants and somatic changes in related tumor tissue.\n",

      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Type 2 diabetes is characterized by insulin resistance and disordered beta-cell function, especially a defect in glucose-stimulated insulin-secretion. Insulin receptors and signaling proteins are found within the beta-cells themselves. Recent evidence in rodents suggests the insulin signaling pathway is functional in islets and is important for glucose sensing. The physiologic role of insulin signaling within beta-cells in humans remains unknown. Our preliminary studies demonstrate that in healthy humans beta-cells are insulin sensitive tissues and raising circulating insulin levels by exogenous insulin administration can enhance glucose induced insulin secretion. We hypothesize that dysfunctional insulin signaling, i.e. insulin resistance, at the level of the beta-cell may be one mechanism underlying blunted insulin secretion in persons with type 2 diabetes and insulin resistant syndromes, which would be manifest as reduced insulin potentiation of glucose induced insulin secretion. We propose to further our understanding of insulin's effects on the beta-cell in healthy persons and to determine whether insulin potentiation of glucose induced insulin secretion is blunted in persons with type 2 diabetes. We demonstrate insulin potentiates glucose induced insulin secretion in the setting of suppression of circulating FFA. Several studies suggest an essential role for FFA in both basal and glucose stimulated insulin secretion, while other studies suggest that excess FFA are lipotoxic to the a-cell. To test whether replacement of FFA will enhance insulin potentiation of glucose induced insulin secretion, or whether the response is secondary to the suppression of circulating FFA, we will evaluate the role of free fatty acids in insulin potentiation of glucose induced insulin production. We demonstrate a marked increase in glucose disposal rates with dextrose administration following insulin pre-exposure. We will evaluate whether this occurs within hepatic or muscle tissues using positron emission tomography imaging. To better understand the molecular pathways underlying these processes, mechanistic studies will be conducted in control and insulin receptor deficient islets, in vitro. These studies may provide a unifying explanation linking the combined defects in insulin secretion and action that underlie type 2 diabetes.\n",

      "--------------------\n",
      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Persistent viral infections are a worldwide health concern, with over 500 million people infected with HIV and hepatitis B and C viruses (HBV, HCV). By definition, immune escape is required for viral persistence; however the suppressive mechanisms that abort immunity during persistent viral infections are not well defined. T cell responses are crucial to prevent and control viral infections. Although robust T cell responses are initially mounted to these viruses, T cells rapidly lose activity permitting persistence. Recent evidence suggests that the functionally non-responsive T cell state (exhaustion) is not programmed during T cell activation, but that T cell responses are actively suppressed throughout infection. We discovered that infection with a persistent strain of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) triggers high IL-10 production that directly ablates T cell function and causes viral persistence. Antibody blockade of IL-10 restored T cell activity and purged the persistent infection, indicating that host regulatory mechanisms actually permit viral persistence and are actively responsible for preventing clearance. This research suggests the exciting prospect that, when freed, T cells are capable of controlling persistent viruses. A better understanding of how immunosuppressive factors inhibit immunity is critical for the design of therapies to re-establish immune control and prevent and potentially eradicate persistent viral infections. In the current proposal I will define the mechanisms leading to IL-10 mediated immunosuppression during persistent viral infection. I will utilize cutting- edge microscopy techniques to directly visualize immunosuppressive cells in vivo and the specific interactions that suppress T cell function and sustain T cell exhaustion. These studies will provide the first in vivo mechanistic insights into how host molecules cause immunosuppression during persistent viral infection. I will then test a novel strategy to enhance T cell immunity and purge a long- lived reservoir of viral replication from an immune privileged site. Once completed this effort will have a direct impact toward our understanding of host-virus interactions, the mechanisms employed to promote viral clearance versus persistence and therapeutically the ability to restore immune function to completely eliminate persistent infection.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Strategies to enhance immune activity to clear persistent viral infections have so far been unsuccessful because it is unclear what is required of the immune response to purge virus once it proceeds past acute infection. The experiments outlined in this proposal will investigate a novel factor required to clear a persistent viral infection. Identification of the mechanisms that sustain immunity will aid in the design of therapies to amplify the immune response to control persistent viral infections\n",

      "climate species change forest changes ecosystem project ecosystems land ecological\n",
      "--------------------\n",
      "Most studies of the effects of climate change on forests have focused on the direct effects of predicted changes in temperature and precipitation.  However, it is clear that in addition to the direct effects of climate on the functioning of forest ecosystems, there will also be indirect effects caused by climate-driven changes in tree species composition.    As the climate warms, the ranges of North American tree species will gradually shift northward.  At any given location, this will produce a change in tree species, favoring those species adapted to warmer climates.  Because tree species are unique in many different ways, the change in species composition will alter the functioning of the forest ecosystem.   This species change is not included in most computer models that predict the effects of climate change on forests.  This study will fill that gap by linking two separate computer models with a statistical model that predicts how the ranges of tree species will shift as the climate changes, and a simulation model that predicts the effects of the species change on key aspects of forest function such as productivity, carbon storage, and nitrogen cycling.    The linked models will be used to forecast the effects of climate change on forest functioning for several realistic scenarios of climate change over the next century.  This initial effort is focused on the Northeastern U.S., but the approach and the models are potentially applicable to forests throughout the country, and even throughout the world, if sufficient information is available about the characteristics of the most important tree species. This project is a collaborative effort involving the Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies and the USDA Forest Service.This research will have significant impacts on the scientific community studying climate change by focusing attention on the important, but often ignored, issue of how changes in tree species composition will affect the functioning and resillience of forests.  In addition, this is clearly a policy-relevant question that is important for issues of forest growth, biodiversity, carbon sequestration, and retention of air pollution-derived nitrogen in forested watersheds in the Northeast.  The principal investigators from the Cary Institute and the Forest Service will make the results of this research available and accessible to policy makers, natural resource managers, and the general public. The results of the study, including the technical details of the model results, will be available on web sites that will be maintained and supported by project staff.  The models developed in this project will be useful for analysis of other important issues of global change, including tree species change caused by introductions of non-native insect pests and pathogens and by invasions of non-native plants. This project will also support educational opportunities for one postdoctoral associate and two undergraduate students.\n",

      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study (FFS) is a nationally representative, birth cohort study of approximately 4900 children born in large US cities (populations of 200,000 or more) between 1998 and 2000. The study includes: (1) interviews with mothers and fathers at birth and again when children are 1, 3, 5 and 9 years old, (2) medical records for a subset of mothers and children at birth, (3) in-home assessments of children and their home environments when children are 3, 5, and 9 years old, (4) interviews with children at age 9, (5) interviews with teachers when children are 3, 5, and 9 years old and (6) DNA samples from mothers and children when children are age 9. The study also includes in-depth, longitudinal interviews with a subset of approximately 75 couples during the first four years after the child's birth. The study design called for a large oversample of births to unmarried parents, and thus the data are a valuable resource for studying health disparities among minority and economically disadvantaged populations. To date, more than 1300 researchers have downloaded the public use data, and Google Scholar lists 730 scholarly articles, theses, books, and abstracts using the FFS data for the period covered by the current NICHD grant, 2006-2011. We seek funding to conduct another round of interviews with mothers and children when children are 15 years old. Our specific aims are to:   Update information on children's health and development and collect new data on health and health risk behavior, school performance, and anti- and pro-social behavior when children are age 15   Update information on contextual factors, including families, neighborhoods, schools and peers, when children are age 15, including retrospective data on family experiences since the last interview  Collect saliva samples from 3,600 children at age 15 to be used for future methylation analysis Approximately 3600 mothers and 3100 children will be interviewed via phone. These phone interviews will be 55 minutes for mothers and 45 minutes for children. Five hundred adolescents will be interviewed in person for approximately 1 hour.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will extend the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study (FFS), a nationally representative, birth cohort study of approximately 4900 children born in large US cities (populations of 200,000 or more) between 1998 and 2000, by collecting data from mothers and adolescents when the children are 15 years old on children's health and health risk behavior, school performance, and anti- and pro-social behavior; on contextual factors, including families, neighborhoods, schools, and peers; and on methylation using saliva samples from 3600 children at age 15. Adolescence is a critical period in human development when children engage in both positive and negative behaviors that are known to have lasting consequences for future health and wellbeing. The new data will dramatically increase our knowledge of how children's experiences in early and middle childhood influence adolescent behaviors and, ultimately, health and wellbeing in adulthood.\n",

      "C. Data Management and Analysis Core1. ObjectiveThe objective of the Data Management and Analysis Core is to continue to provide data managementservices and statistical expertise to Program Project investigators in a wide range of data acquisition andanalysis activities. Integral to the goals of each project is the management and analysis of Core observational,interview, questionnaire, and behavioral data, as well as management and analysis of data from the individualprojects. Data management activities draw on the considerable resources of the Data Management andAnalysis Center (DMAC) at the Frank Porter Graham Child Development Center (FPG) at UNC and TheMethodology Center (TMC) at PSD. Specific Aims of the Data Management and Analysis Core are to:1) Implement the planned missing design in conjunction with the Executive Committee.2) Develop and maintain data management strategies that process data collected in the common protocol andthe individual projects efficiently and accurately.3) Design and maintain integrated databases of project and common protocol data.4) Develop and implement data analysis plans using innovative analytic methods for longitudinal dataincluding variable-centered and person-centered approaches to address research questions incollaboration with project investigators.5) To set in place a data archiving system for data sharing.These goals require the collaboration of experienced statisticians and computer programmers. The DMACprogrammers have expertise in all aspects of quantitative data management, from the entry and tracking ofdata to the generation of analysis files and statistical programming. The DMAC and TMC statisticianscollaborated with these and other investigators regarding design and statistical issues across many earlychildhood research projects. The Data Management and Analysis Core provides high level expertise to theProgram Project in each of these areas. The use of an experienced data acquisition and analysis center toprocess and analyze data across the projects will provide both high levels of quality control and costeffectiveness.A central data acquisition and analysis center is especially important for this Program Project because datafrom each project contributes to the common protocol for use by all projects in addressing their hypotheses.In particular, executive functioning and self regulation measures collected by Project I, classroom observationsand child cognitive/academic outcomes collected by Project II, and family process measures collected byProject III, and community measures from the core are primary predictor or outcome measures used inanalyses by all projects. Central coordination of data processing and analysis will ensure the consistent andtimely processing of these Â¿data^for-all- inyestigatgrsv Careful documentation of data scoring, including the reliability and distributions of summary variables, will facilitate the use of one project's data by other projectinvestigators.The services provided by the Data Management and Analysis Core pertain to almost all phases of theresearch including design, data collection, data entry, and analysis. The main advantage of having acentralized facility for data management and computing is the ability to provide coordinated services thataddress the wide range of issues involved in these activities. By coordinating data processing activities for allprojects, duplication of effort is reduced, efficiencies of data management and analyses are generated, andopportunities for higher level analysis across data sets from different projects are made available. Thus,maximum communication is obtained across all projects to further the understanding of data to be analyzed, aswell as the statistical procedures for those analyses. Furthermore, synergy among projects is enhancedthrough having the same programmers and statisticians working across projects.\n",

      "smoking smokers cessation relapse quit abstinence tobacco cigarette craving smoke\n",
      "--------------------\n",
      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): People with schizophrenia have two- to three-times the mortality risk of the general population. This is primarily due to their unusually high rates o cigarette smoking, as well as other cardiovascular risk factors such as physical inactivity, obesity, high blood cholesterol and diabetes. Effective smoking treatments are needed to reduce morbidity and mortality in this population. Over a dozen experimental studies indicate that walking and other forms of exercise acutely reduce cigarette craving, nicotine withdrawal symptoms and smoking behavior in non-psychiatric smokers. However, the effects of acute exercise on smoking measures have not been studied in smokers with schizophrenia. The primary aim of this NIH Exploratory/Developmental (R21) Research Grant application is to investigate the acute effects of exercise, compared to a passive control condition, on subjective and behavioral smoking measures in smokers with schizophrenia. As episodic craving following exposure to smoking cues is associated with relapse during quit attempts, the secondary aim is to investigate whether exposure to smoking cues alters the ability of exercise to reduce cigarette craving and other smoking measures. The tertiary aim is to investigate whether factors known to moderate responses to smoking cessation medications (gender, antipsychotic medication type, intention to quit smoking) moderate the effects of exercise on smoking measures. This study will use a within-subjects, repeated-measures design, in which participants will undergo 1 practice session followed by 4 experimental sessions: (1) smoking cues followed by exercise, (2) smoking cues followed by passive activity, (3) neutral cues followed by exercise, (4) neutral cues followed by passive activity. Outcome measures include cigarette craving, nicotine withdrawal symptoms, mood and smoking behavior. If the results of this study indicate that walking acutely reduces craving and smoking in smokers with schizophrenia, the next step in this research would be to test the effectiveness of a smoking cessation intervention that incorporates exercise bouts as a behavioral strategy for improving smoking cessation rates in this population.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: There is an unusually high rate of cigarette smoking among people with schizophrenia and correspondingly high rates of smoking-related morbidity and mortality in these patients. The aim of this project is to examine, under laboratory conditions, whether exercise reduces cigarette craving, nicotine withdrawal symptoms and smoking behavior in smokers with schizophrenia. If so, the next step in this research would be to examine the effectiveness of a smoking cessation intervention that incorporates exercise bouts as a behavioral strategy for reducing cigarette craving and smoking in smokers with schizophrenia.\n",

      "nicotine tobacco dependence addiction nachrs nachr nicotinic withdrawal cigarettes effects\n",
      "--------------------\n",
      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The CNS effects of nicotine are mediated by multiple subtypes of neuronal nicotinic cholinergic receptors (nAChRs). The effects of nicotine after chronic administration differ from those after acute administration, and nicotine effects also vary at different stages of development. Our previous work characterized the effects of chronic nicotine on expression and function of different subtypes of nAChRs. Knowledge of the shifting expression pattern of these receptors during nicotine use is critical for understanding cholinergic neurophysiology as well as nicotine pharmacology. Chronic nicotine is associated with dependence, changes in gene expression and behavior, and altered neural development. This latter effect is of critical importance given the widespread exposure to nicotine that occurs during periods of critical neural development, particularly due to prenatal exposure from mothers who smoke or use NRT products, and adolescents who are beginning to experiment with tobacco. Prenatal nicotine exposure can have profound effects upon subsequent development and behavior of offspring. Adolescent exposure to nicotine is associated with higher rates of adult dependence, both to nicotine and to other drugs of abuse. Thus these represent uniquely vulnerable periods for nicotine exposure. The overarching goal of the present proposal is to compare the effects of chronic nicotine exposure at three critical ages: prenatal, adolescence and adult. We will employ rat models to study the overlapping effects of chronic nicotine exposure on nAChR expression and function, neuronal morphology and gene expression; we will focus on receptors, genes and brain regions associated with nicotine dependence. In particular, we will examine for persistent effects of nicotine exposure on these parameters. These studies will test the general hypothesis that nicotine's effects on these parameters differ at different developmental stages of exposure. In particular, Aim 4 will test the hypothesis that prenatal nicotine exposure inhibits the response of adolescents to subsequent nicotine challenge, increasing the number of cigarettes smoked and thus the likelihood of subsequent dependence. For each of the following Specific Aims, we will test for both the short-term and persistent effects of chronic nicotine exposure on expression (using autoradiography and immunoprecipitation) and function (using rubidium efflux and neurotransmitter release) of nAChR subtypes, alteration of neuronal morphology (measuring dendritic length and spine density), and changes in global gene expression (using microarrays and rtPCR) in brain regions associated with nicotine dependence. Differential developmental effects will be determined by comparison across aims. SPECIFIC AIMS 1. Determine the immediate and the persistent direct effects of prenatal chronic nicotine exposure. 2. Determine the immediate and the persistent direct effects of adolescent chronic nicotine exposure. 3. Determine the immediate and the persistent direct effects of adult nicotine exposure. 4. Determine the persistent indirect effects of prenatal nicotine exposure by determining how prenatal nicotine exposure alters the ability of the adolescent to respond to a new nicotine exposure\n",

      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Lung diseases, including lung cancer and chronic lung diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, together account for some 280,000 deaths annually (American Lung Association). Contributing to this mortality is the fact that remediation of all forms of lung disease is hampered by the limited ability of lung to regenerate. Hence, lung tissue that is damaged by degeneration or infection, or lung tissue that is surgically resected, is not functionally replaced in vivo. Currently, the only way to replace lung tissue is to perform lung transplantation, an expensive procedure that is achieves only a 10% survival at 10 years, and one that is hampered by a severe shortage of organs.  Over the past 3 years, we have worked to address some fundamental challenges in lung tissue engineering. In order to produce a lung scaffold that has suitable geometry and mechanics for lung regeneration, we have developed technologies to decellularize entire lung tissues. We have shown that these acellular lung matrices retain the gross mechanical properties of the original lung tissues, and provide outstanding support for the adhesion and growth of epithelial and vascular cells. We have developed a novel,  biomimetic  bioreactor that provides for long-term sterile lung culture, circulation of nutrient medium through the lung vascular compartment, and  breathing  of nutrient medium into the airway. As a cell source to repopulate the acellular lung matrix, we have utilized syngeneic neonatal rat lung cells, as these cells show significant potential for growth inside the developing lung. We have made substantial and exciting progress in this work, and have shown the feasibility of regenerating many characteristics of lung tissue, but there remain several important issues that must be studied and addressed before the functionality of such lung tissues can be tested in vivo. Most fundamentally, in order to exchange gas, the lung must comprise sufficient alveolar diffusional surface area, must be populated with functional and differentiated epithelial cell subsets at correct anatomic locations in the alveoli and elsewhere, and must be invested with a functional microvasculature that withstands physiological perfusion pressures and does not leak fluid into the alveolar compartment. In this proposal, we will study and refine the lung tissue engineering system in order to address each of these issues and advance the central mission of functional lung regeneration, which is the capacity for effective gas exchange. We hypothesize that the acellular lung matrix, when suitably re-populated with lung epithelium and vascular cells, will support the growth and differentiation of these cells and will produce a tissue that is effective for gas exchange, based upon in vitro measurements.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Lung diseases, including lung cancer and chronic lung diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, together account for some 280,000 deaths annually.

      "--------------------\n",
      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): How proteins fold, that is attain their three-dimensional structure, is a fundamental biological process with important implications for human health. Misfolded proteins are often toxic, as illustrated by the number of neurodegenerative diseases referred to as  protein folding diseases . Molecular chaperones play vital roles in remodeling protein structure -- assisting de novo protein folding, preventing protein aggregation and disassembling protein complexes. Hsp70-based machineries, having J-proteins as obligate components, are amongst the most highly conserved molecular chaperone systems. J-proteins are a very diverse set of proteins, having only the 70 amino acid J-domain in common. All J-proteins share the ability to stimulate the ATPase activity of their partner Hsp70s, allowing them to capture client proteins. But it is their functional diversity that enables them to orchestrate Hsp70's capacity to participate in a wide array of complex and diverse biological functions. This proposal focuses on understanding the basis of the specificity of J-proteins function. Two J-proteins of the yeast cytosol have been chosen for in depth analysis: Sis1 and Zuo1. This choice is based on their critical importance and their high degree of sequence conservation. Their human homologs are able to substitute for the yeast proteins, thus the outcome of this work will serve as a paradigm for understanding J-protein function in other organisms. To understand the specificity of Sis1, its function in the propagation of yeast prions will be exploited, as it is specifically required for fragmentation of prion complexes. Thus, results will also yield important information about the biogenesis and propagation of these self-replicating amyloid protein aggregates. Zuo1 is a highly conserved ribosome-associated chaperone that facilitates interaction of Hsp70 with nascent polypeptides as they exit the ribosome. Ribosome-associated chaperones serve as a link between protein synthesis and protein folding and are thus a key to the cell<s production of functional proteins. In addition, we will investigate roles of molecular chaperones in the nucleus, focusing on novel regulatory functions independent of and separable from chaperone activity. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The research described in this proposal focuses on understanding the processes of protein folding and maturation within living cells and the important roles of molecular chaperones in them. Productive protein folding is critical to normal cell function; protein misfolding is the primary cause of many human diseases, including cystic fibrosis and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease.\n",

      "Published reports on software-development costs and our interactions with many companies reveal that testing and debugging consume too much of the development costs. Furthermore, the ubiquitous nature of software requires that it be high quality. Thus, there is an urgent need for technology that companies can use to improve the process to reduce the cost of these activities and improve the quality of the software. The technology that this team will explore for commercialization consists of rigorous techniques that are highly automated, and have the potential to improve reliability and adaptability of today's large, complex software systems at a reduced cost. These techniques have provided the foundations in testing and debugging on which many additional techniques have been developed. The techniques have been implemented in prototype tools that have been used for experimentation that shows their effectiveness and efficiency in improving the quality of the software and reducing the cost of achieving it. However, no commercial tools or systems currently provide this advanced technology. The team's project has the potential to provide such tools and systems. The technology the team plans to commercialize will improve the efficiency and effectiveness of software development by addressing the process of testing and debugging. Not only will the technology result in higher-quality software for those companies who use it, but it will provide savings in the costs of the software development. Because the technology can be used for testing and debugging at all levels of development (e.g., individual, team, and system), on systems written in different programming languages and on non-code components (e.g., databases), by companies that develop software for their own use or to sell, and by companies of all sizes, the commercialization of the technology can have a significant impact on industry. If successful in commercializing the technology, the tools and systems being built will ultimately improve software quality and, thus, has the potential to have a significant societal benefit. The project will prepare students and faculty who participate in the important area of entrepreneurship, which will help them transition the technology developed to industry.\n",

      "Title: Biological physics of DNA bending  DNA is one of the essential molecules of life, carrying the genetic information of a cell.  The mechanical properties of DNA are related to the ability of different protein complexes to bind to DNA, and control gene expression and DNA repair.  Understanding DNA mechanics, especially at short length scales, ends up being more complicated than the mechanics of more classic materials such as an elastic rod, given the double-helical nature and inhomogeneous building blocks of DNA.  This research will produce physical insights that will advance our understanding of the relationship between DNA mechanics and several important DNA-related biological processes. In this project, the PI will investigate how sharp DNA bending promotes tight packaging of the genome, local defects in the double helix, and protein transport between DNA sites, all features that have implications on gene expression and DNA repair.  The PI will train undergraduates in his lab and offer scientific demonstrations to K-12 students.    Despite the current atomistic-level knowledge of DNA structure, conformational changes and fluctuations of DNA at short length scales are not trivial to understand. Especially, spontaneous looping of DNA is highly sensitive to sequence, intrinsic curvature, and length scale. In this project, the PI will investigate how biophysics of spontaneous DNA looping impacts DNA-protein interactions. In the first aim, the PI will measure stability of small DNA loops as a function of nucleosome preference. This aim will address whether the sequence rule of nucleosome formation can be better understood from DNA mechanics in the strong bending regime. In the second aim, the PI will measure stability of small DNA loops with and without highly meltable regions. This aim will address whether strong DNA bending can enhance local melting of duplex DNA. In the third aim, the PI will measure association and dissociation kinetics of DNA binding proteins in various DNA constructs. This aim will address whether DNA looping can facilitate protein transfer. The PI will use single-molecule fluorescence techniques and coarse-grained DNA models to conduct this research.\n",

      "circadian clock rhythms clocks scn light rhythm bmal1 metabolic melatonin\n",
      "--------------------\n",
      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Circadian rhythms, roughly 24-hour rhythms in physiology and behavior, are widespread in nature and can be found in many plants and animals. Disruption of circadian rhythms has been linked to human health disorders ranging from jet lag to sleep and mood disorders and even to cancer. In eukaryotes, the circadian clocks that drive these rhythms are composed of networks of interlocked transcriptional feedback loops, in which positive factors induce the expression of negative factors that in turn repress expression of the positive factors. Although individual clock components are not conserved across kingdoms, clear analogies can be drawn between the organization of the circadian system and the `wiring' of the central clock, or oscillator, between disparate organisms. A fundamental understanding of how the circadian clock works in a variety of model systems will lead to new insights into the functioning of the human circadian system and its role in human health and disease. The long-term goal of the proposed research is to better understand the molecular basis of circadian rhythms in eukaryotes. These studies will be performed in Arabidopsis thaliana, a model organism with extensive genetic and genomic resources that is well-suited to circadian research. Some predicted components of the Arabidopsis central clock have not yet been identified, the biochemical functions of many known clock genes have not been determined, and it is not understood how the clock regulates growth and development. The proposed studies will use genetic, genomic, and biochemical techniques to address these fundamental questions. First, the molecular function of a clock-associated protein that is highly conserved across eukaryotes will be determined by a combination of genetic and biochemical studies in Arabidopsis and fission yeast. Second, a gene that acts close to the central clock will be cloned and characterized. Finally, the targets of a clock-regulated transcription factor that modulates the central clock and regulates organ size will be identified. These studies will yield important insights into the workings of the circadian clock and how it regulates growth and development in a complex eukaryote, information that ultimately may be used to improve human health through treatment of circadian disorders. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Almost all organisms possess an internal clock that generates roughly 24-hour rhythms in physiology or behavior. Disruption of this circadian clock in humans has serious negative consequences, causing sleep and mood disorders and perhaps even contributing to diseases such as cancer. To better understand the molecular basis of circadian rhythms, we are carrying out extensive genetic, biochemical, and genomic studies on the model organism Arabidopsis thaliana.\n",

      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Summary The purpose of this project is to demonstrate major improvements in care quality through redesign of care delivery in the University of Utah Community Clinics. The Community Clinics (CC) are a fee-for-service 10-site primary- and secondary-care system with about 50 primary care physicians, 350,000 annual visits, and 120,000 active patients. The CC have led primary care delivery reform since 2003 when we began the development and implementation of a new model of care called Care By Design (CBD). The three organizing principles of CBD are: Appropriate Access (AA), Care teams (CT), and Planned care (PC). It is within this existing system design that we will implement additional redesigns. In this project we will implement a comprehensive care management program targeted to patients with multiple chronic conditions. Our delivery redesign will include strategies for effectively managing care transitions and for aggressively screening for and treating depression, a complicating co-morbidity for many patients with chronic conditions. Our intervention builds upon and strengthens CBD in order to achieve major improvements in care quality. We will compare the CCs' current clinical outcomes with outcomes prior to introduction of CBD's system designs and with those achieved with our redesign components. In addition, a quasi- experimental cohort design will document improvements in clinical quality and engagement of patients and care teams as clinics enhance CBD sequentially over the three year project. Intermediate outcomes will include provider and staff use rates of EMR best practice reminders and patient and care team adherence to CER-informed guidelines. Patient engagement will be assessed by patient use of our web portal, care manager supports, and adherence to personalized care plans. We will use our EMR and CBD implementation instrument to assess staff, provider, and patient behavior, and surveys of patient activation, experience with care, and quality of life, and of provider attitudes toward patient self-management to assess quality. An important goal of our project is evaluation of the impact of our interventions and strategies on clinic ROI. We anticipate changes in volume and related revenue for ancillary tests, services, and pharmacy as we manage the care needs of our high risk patients more effectively. We will evaluate the business case for implementing currently uncompensated components of care in our fee for service environment. Additionally, by using two unique state-wide databases, we will evaluate the impact of our redesign on total cost and cost effectiveness of care by measuring emergency department visits, hospital admissions, readmissions, and associated costs of care, demonstrating the potential for decreased costs of care in the broader community. These data are key to creating a business model for sustainability of enhanced CER-informed care. Our strong interdisciplinary research team ensures successful completion of this project. The team includes developers of CBD, clinician specialists in geriatrics and pharmacy practice, members with expertise in quality improvement, biostatistics, qualitative research, behavioral sciences, and economics, and a national advisory committee that includes leading experts in practice redesign and multi-methods evaluation. Results of this project will provide practical guidance for others seeking to implement CER-informed care in primary care practices.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  This project specifically addresses the purposes of the grant program to demonstrate the feasibility and value of implementing evidence-based care improvement strategies and interventions in delivery systems as well as a number of objectives of Healthy People 2010 including improving access to comprehensive, high-quality health care services. This project implements a comprehensive program of care management for patients with multiple chronic conditions and evaluates the impact of transformation to a PCMH delivery model of primary care practices in a University network serving a broad patient population. The project addresses a broad goal for Healthy People 2010, to  Achieve access to preventive services for all Americans  by implementing best practices reminders in our EMR, pre-visit planning, and registry-based outreach.\n",

      "--------------------\n",
      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dopamine plays a role in multiple physiological processes ranging from movement and reward to the regulation of hormonal balance. Dopamine receptor agonists or antagonists are used for the treatment of diseases such as schizophrenia, depression, attention deficit disorder, and Parkinson's disease. Recent work also indicates that the altered regulation of dopamine release induced by many drugs of abuse plays a critical role in early processes linked to early aspects of addiction. This there is a considerable understanding of the physiological role of dopamine in the central nervous system. There is likewise an enormous literature on molecular and biochemical aspects of dopamine signaling. Studies range from, the expression of the multiple is forms of dopamine receptors and second messenger cascades in cell lines to, biochemical and electrophysiological examination of the actions of dopamine and receptor agonists on neurons in various parts of the central nervous system. Thus the signaling cascades that are activated by dopamine receptors are well characterized. In spite of the wealth of knowledge of the dopamine system, little has been done on the actions of synaptically released dopamine at the cellular level. This hole in knowledge is not for the lack of effort, but lies in the fact that robust physiological detectors linked to dopamine synapses have been difficult to find in the major projection areas. This proposal uses recordings from dopamine neurons in brain slices from mouse to (1) define the inhibitory synaptic potential (IPSP) that results from the dendritic release of dopamine, (2) identify the presynaptic mechanism(s) and sites of dendritic dopamine release and (3) determine how the dendritic release of dopamine is altered following the induction of excitatory synaptic plasticity resulting from the treatment of animals with cocaine. The robust connection between the dendritic release of dopamine and the activation of an IPSC remains the best and probably only site at which dopamine transmission has been directly examined. The results of this study will therefore form a connection between knowledge at molecular and systems levels. The characterization of the synaptic mechanisms that determine rise and fall of extracellular dopamine in combination with a physiological response, will add considerably to the decades long search for an understanding of the role of dopamine in health and disease.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Dopamine agonists and antagonists are used clinically for the treatment of a number of diseases pointing out the importance of a complete understanding of the cellular and synaptic processes mediated by this important transmitter. The results from this study will define the cellular interactions between endogenously released dopamine and the receptors that detect the release of dopamine. From this work knowledge of dopamine-dependent transmission in many areas of the brain will be facilitated and lead to a better understanding of the disruptions in transmission in many diseases including addiction.\n",

      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Abuse of cocaine is a widespread and severely deleterious public health problem. Although it is well established that there is substantial variability in an individual's response to cocaine exposure, we do not yet understand the mechanisms that mediate individual differences in the etiology of cocaine abuse and addiction. In particular, we do not understand why some individuals are resistant to the effects of cocaine and will consume cocaine at low rates whereas other individuals are relatively vulnerable to the effects of cocaine and will consume cocaine at high rates. In the present proposal, we will evaluate several novel biomarkers that may predict the vulnerability of an individual to abuse cocaine or to relapse following abstinence. We will evaluate these processes using drug self-administration (SA) and reinstatement of previously drug-maintained behavior in nonhuman primates, as these are well established animal models of cocaine abuse and relapse. Moreover, we propose to determine, in a highly systematic manner, whether the availability of specific brain proteins, the acute brain activational effects of cocaine, or the integrity of functional bran networks predicts cocaine abuse and relapse. We believe that these studies will have important public health implications because these techniques can be translated into use in human subjects, and they will allow physicians to individually tailor treatment plans based on the current status of the cocaine-dependent patient.\n",

      "Title: Animal Imaging Core Recent advances in small animal imaging have substantially improved our ability to gain insights into disease progression without altering the biological systems. The small animal imaging facility at UNC currently houses nine major imaging equipments, including MRI (2), PET/CT (1), CT (1), SPECT (1), optical imaging (3), and ultrasound (1). In addition, skillful technical staff members to maintain and operate the imaging equipments and animal technicians to facilitate animal preparation for imaging and monitoring during imaging are available. Leveraging on these impressive resources, the small animal imaging (SAI) core aims to provide advanced imaging technology to facilitate the proposed projects. Specifically, two major imaging tasks will be carried out for the proposed projects, including to depict biodistribution of nanoparticles (Projects 1, 2, and 3) and to monitor and evaluate therapeutic efficacy of the proposed nanoparticles or treatment regimens (Projects 2, 3, and 4) using imaging methods. To accomplish the former task, both PET and optical imaging methods will be developed to more efficiently and accurately provide biodistribution information. For the latter task, four imaging modalities, including optical, CT, PET, and MRI will be used to monitor therapeutic efficacy. Finally, while the imaging capability in the small animal imaging facility is already impressive, our institution has committed additional funds to further augment the imaging program at UNC, including the establishment of an on-site cyclotron facility and the associated radiochemistry lab and the development of imaging registration approaches for multimodality imaging using microCT, MRI, and PET (Projects 2, 3 and 4). Together, we believe that the available technical expertise and well established infrastructure in the small animal imaging facility will greatly facilitate the success ofthe proposed projects.\n",

      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adult stem cells play an important role in replenishing the pool of highly differentiated but short-lived cells in different tissues. A unique feature of adult stem cells is their ability to both self-renew to maintain their population and undergo differentiation to replenish the cells of the tissue. Recent findings suggest that some cancers arise due to misregulation of mechanisms that regulate stem cells. Understanding the regulatory pathways that specify stem cell fate may thus inform new approaches for the treatment of cancer. Also, knowledge of stem cell regulation can provide strategies to manipulate adult stem cells in vivo to promote regeneration of damaged tissues. Studies have demonstrated that a key regulator of the decision between self-renewal and differentiation is the signal emanating from the niche cells surrounding the stem cells. The Drosophila male germ line is an excellent model to study interactions between the niche and stem cells in vivo. The niche signal that specifies stem cell self-renewal in the male germ line is well characterized but the downstream stem cell intrinsic regulatory pathways are unknown. The goal of this proposal is to identify cell intrinsic mechanisms that regulate male germ line stem cell behavior in response to the niche signal. The specific aims of this proposal are: 1) To examine the function of one of the genes expressed in the early germ cells, the FoxN class transcription factor, jumu, in specifying stem cell fate by loss and gain of function analysis. 2) To identify genes whose expression is directly regulated by STAT, the transcription factor activated in the stem cells in response to the niche signal, using chromatin immunoprecipitation. The function of these genes in germ line stem cells will be determined by mutational analysis.3) To identify stem cell intrinsic regulatory networks; genes expressed in the stem cell enriched population will be compared to those expressed in committed progenitor cells by microarray analysis. This will help identify mRNAs expressed in stem cells that shut down or are degraded as stem cells differentiate as well as processes that turn on as cells initiate differentiation. Relevance: The goal of this proposal is to identify mechanisms that regulate stem cell behavior in the male germ line of Drosophila; this study may provide models for the regulation of mammalian adult stem cells. Understanding stem cell regulation will be helpful in harnessing the potential of adult stem cells to regenerate damaged tissues. Also, there is evidence that some cancers arise due to defects in stem cell regulation and understanding stem cell behavior can present new strategies to treat cancer.\n",

      "ï»¿   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tumor heterogeneity poses a distinct challenge to effective treatment of cancer patients. Next generating sequencing over the past decade has revealed how the ways in which tumor heterogeneity leads to worse outcomes for patients, by enabling tumors to evolve and develop resistance to targeted therapies. This project aims to investigate the origins of tumor heterogeneity, making use of a mouse model system that is designed to enable the identification of distinct tumor subpopulations and genetic analysis of these populations. This project will combine the disciplines of tumor progression and metastasis, tumor microenvironment studies, and cancer genetics to provide novel insights into the nature of subpopulations within a tumor and evolution of these subpopulations during the course of a tumor's progression from a benign lesion to aggressively metastatic disease. It will be completed primarily by a graduate student with significant experience in mouse carcinogenesis models and next generation sequencing over the course of two years, under the supervision of a faculty sponsor with decades of experience with skin carcinogenesis and cancer genetics.  Objectives: This proposal will (1) study the nature of subpopulations of cells that are found in early tumors, determining whether they are separately arising tumor cells or come from the tumor's microenvironment; (2) determine the behavior and contributions of tumor subpopulations during the course of progression from benign to metastatic disease. This work will provide a foundation for the development of cancer therapies better suited to combatting deadly heterogeneous tumors. Two specific aims are proposed: Aim 1: Test hypothesis that tumors which contain multiple contributing populations are recruiting  normal  tissue from the microenvironment. This aim will study subpopulations that are present within tumors at the earliest stages of tumor development, with the goal of understanding their origins and the long-term contributions they make to the tumor. Aim 2: Determine clonality and growth dynamics of early- and late-stage tumor progression, including the timing of metastatic dissemination. This aim will study tumor subpopulations that develop after the tumor is initiated. Subpopulations will be labeled at 8, 16, or 24 weeks after tumor initiation and their behavior studied as the tumor progresses to malignancy and metastasizes. Labeling subpopulations at different time points will further allow interrogation as to when tumors metastasize, a question that has significant impact of patient treatment strategies.\n",

      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hypertension is the most common modifiable risk factor that leads to the major causes of death and disability in the US. It is a complex, heritable disease of multi-factorial etiology that involves the interactions between environmental factors and multiple genetic susceptibility alleles. It is postulated that the high prevalence and more virulent course of hypertensive vascular disease among African-Americans reflects a critical interplay between genes and environment that is mediated by the vascular epigenome. The pathogenesis of hypertension-induced vascular complications (e.g. stroke) involves long-term changes in vessel function and structure. However, the molecular mechanisms of vascular 'memory' that govern these chronic changes remain poorly defined. Our central hypothesis poses that the chronic maintenance and progressive nature of vascular disease in hypertension is mediated by dynamic changes in the vascular epigenome that promote the selective up-regulation of a  vasculopathic  gene expression profile as well as the coordinate repression of intrinsic  vasculo-protective  genes. The proposed project will utilize genome-wide, deep sequencing technology to characterize a topographical map of DNA and histone methylation marks associated with changes in the hypertensive vascular transcriptome as well as define the dynamic response of the vascular epigenome to therapeutic interventions. We will test several related hypotheses:   There is a distinctive 'molecular signature' of the vascular transcriptome and a corresponding epigenomic pattern of DNA and histone methylation that is characteristic of the microvasculature of African-Americans with hypertension compared to age-matched African-American controls without hypertension.   The clinical efficacy of pharmacologic blockade of angiotensin II in the treatment of hypertension is mediated in part by its distinctive, dynamic effects on the epigenomic pattern of DNA and histone methylation and its consequent influence on the vascular transcriptome.   The blood pressure lowering efficacy of the DASH diet is mediated by specific, nutrient-responsive elements in the vascular epigenome and its consequent effects on the vascular transcriptome. Overall, this project holds promise for creating a unique Epigenomic Data Resource and a novel integration of genetics, epigenetic, nutrigenomics and pharmacogenomics in a common, clinically significant disease that contributes to racial/ethnic disparities in cardiovascular health. It is anticipated that these studies will yield novel insights and new drug discovery paradigms for the treatment of hypertension. Public Health Relevance: High blood pressure affects 1 in 3 adults in the US and is a major cause of strokes and heart attacks. It involves the interplay between genetic predisposition and external factors such as diet (e.g. high salt intake). The pathways that mediate the long-term effects of diet on the function of the blood vessel are unknown. This project will test the hypothesis that the expression of genes that promote or protect individuals from hypertension is modulated by epigenetic marks or codes that are responsive to changes in dietary nutrients.\n",

      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): ABSTRACT The major objective of this proposal is the development of the candidate's academic career in laboratory research of immune pathology that develops after bone marrow transplantation. For 2.5 years, the candidate was funded by a Paul Calebrisi K12 Grant (Dr. Bruce Chabner, PI) at the Harvard Cancer Center as a post- doctoral in Dr. Jerome Ritz' laboratory at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. The candidate now proposes a mentorship plan at the University of North Carolina (UNC), Chapel Hill where she began a tenure-track faculty position on June 1st, 2009. The UNC K08 mentorship program will be headed by Albert Baldwin, Ph.D., who will serve as the candidate's primary mentor. Dr. Baldwin is a leading expert in NFkB signaling with a long track record of successfully mentoring young investigators. He has developed a comprehensive mentorship plan for the candidate primarily focused on developing her knowledge and experimental expertise in TNF family member receptor signaling. The candidate's co-mentor will be Dr. Serody who is an endowed Professor of Medicine, Microbiology and Immunology and co-leader of the Immunology Section in the Lineberger Cancer Center. Dr. Serody is recognized as a leader in the field of Graft versus Host Disease (GVHD) having led several NIH-funded laboratory studies focused on the role of chemokine receptors and immune regulatory cells in GVHD. A comprehensive clinical data base developed by one of the candidate's key collaborators, Dr. Thomas Shea, in conjunction with an IRB tissue procurement protocol at UNC will allow Dr. Sarantopoulos to collect and characterize samples from patients who have undergone allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). In addition, Dr. Jerome Ritz from Dana-Farber Cancer Center, Dr. Nelson Chao from Duke University and Dr. Stephanie Lee from Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center will collaborate and supply the candidate with fresh and cryopreserved HSCT patient samples. Finally, Dr. Sarantopoulos has assembled a local UNC expert scientific advisory committee comprised of Dr. Stephen Clarke and Dr. Barbara Vilen in the, Department Microbiology & Immunology at UNC, both experts in B cell pathobiology. Her mentors and expert advisory committee will enable the candidate to combine what she has previously learned and accomplished with detailed, specific apprenticeship training in TNF family member receptor signaling. Research will focus on studies of significant immune pathology that develops in patients after treatment for cancer with allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). The long-term goal of this research project is to understand the role of B cell Activating Factor of the TNF family (BAFF) and its associated signaling pathways. The proposed experiments will allow for future development of novel targeted therapeutic agents for chronic GVHD and improved overall survival of cancer patients. The mentorship, didactics, and research proposal along with the academic and research infrastructure provided by UNC and the Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center will ensure the candidate's successful transition to an NIH-funded independent investigator.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: NARRATIVE Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCST) is the only known curative option for many of the approximately 40 per 100,000 Americans afflicted with life-threatening blood-borne cancers. After HCST, chronic graft versus host disease (cGVHD) develops in 30-70% of patients carrying an impact on survival that has not improved significantly over the last 30 years. The current research will advance knowledge about immunopathologic mechanisms in human cGVHD. Our findings have implications for treatment of neoplastic, autoimmune and infectious diseases.\n",

      "This report includes work arising from the following clinical protocols: NCT00026832, NCT00100360, NCT00001177, and NCT00001322.Behavioral observations from this and a related study in healthy young men, show that clinically significant depressive symptoms are rare accompaniments of induced hypogonadism in these healthy premenopausal women and men. Although hypogonadism is accompanied by hot flushes and disturbed sleep in approximately 80% and decreased sexual function in approximately 30% of these women, neither night-time hot flushes nor disturbed sleep are sufficient to cause depressive symptoms in more than 5% of hypogonadal young women (or men).  Thus this paradigm serves as an excellent comparison group for women with reproductive endocrine-related mood disorders who undergo identical hormone manipulations. Additionally, in a naturalistic study, we have demonstrated that healthy premenopausal women experience no change in behavior after blockade of the formation of the neurosteroid metabolites of progesterone during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. Thus, as with our studies of induced hypogonadism, acute short term  manipulations of neuroactive steroids have little effect on the behavior of most women (in contrast to the observed effects in women with reproductive endocrine-related mood disorders reported in ZIAMH002865).  We are pursuing our original findings from brain imaging studies that ovarian steroids modulate prefrontal cortical activity but only in some women. One potential source of this variation in response to ovarian steroids is genotype. We examined the impact of the interaction of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) Val66Met polymorphism and ovarian hormones on PET measurements of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) and fMRI blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal while women performed the 2-back working memory task and a 0-back sensorimotor control.  In both measures (i.e., rCBF and BOLD), and in only Met carriers (i.e., women with the BDNF met allele in replace of the normal Val allele), the hippocampus was abnormally activated (not deactivated) during estradiol but not during the hypogonadal state or progesterone replacement.  Separate analyses of the 0-back and 2-back indicate that these changes were due to neural activity during the working memory (2-back) condition and not the sensorimotor (0-back) control task.  Additionally, the Met carriers had abnormal functional connectivity between the DLPFC and hippocampus during estradiol conditions only as well as trends for similar differences in hippocampal activation in our fMRI studies. This study is the first in women to demonstrate a BDNF genotype by estradiol interaction on a cognitively-related neurophysiological response.  These data suggest that the Met allele of the BDNF gene conveys an abnormal sensitivity to the presence of estradiol on hippocampal function, similar to that reported in the Met knock-in mice compared with wild type mice.    Results of similar studies in women with PMDD are close to completion pending the recruitment of a sufficient number of Met carriers to repeat this analysis in these women whose affective symptoms are menstrual cycle dependent The findings of these genotype by estradiol interactions have been complimented by similar studies in basic neuroscience. In a collaboration between BEB and Bruce McEwens laboratory at Rockefeller University (made possible by an NIH Bench to Bedside grant), we have performed similar studies in ovariectomized wild type and BDNF knock-in mice (BDNF+/+ and BDNF+/Met , respectively). Preliminary observations suggest that estradiol induces depressive-like behavior in OVX BDNF+/Met, which displayed a reduced number of grooming sessions compared to vehicle treated OVX BDNF+/Met (Consistent with estradiol-induced abnormal hippocampal activation in women). Also, we observed that ovariectomy affected cognitive performance in BDNF+/+ but not in BDNF+/Met. Indeed, only vehicle treated OVX BDNF+/+ showed no discrimination of the misplaced object. These findings also suggest that the Met allele might confer cognitive protection during estradiol fluctuation and explain some of the individual variability in the occurrence of cognitive/affective symptoms experienced by perimenopausal women and the benefits of estradiol therapy for cognitive complaints in these women. We are currently examining the gene expression profile in the different tissues collected. These findings lay the groundwork for novel investigations aimed at determining how the interplay between sex hormones and the BDNF Met allele increases the risk for affective disorders at discrete time points in a womans life. In a separate study, we examined the effects of sex hormones on cognitive function. Despite well-established sex differences in the performance on tests of several cognitive domains (e.g., visuospatial ability), few studies in humans have evaluated if these sex differences are evident both in the presence of circulating sex hormones and during sex steroid hormonal suppression.   Sex differences identified in the relative absence of circulating levels of estradiol and testosterone suggest that differences in brain structure or function exist independent of current hormonal environment and are more likely a reflection of differing developmental exposures and/or genetic substrates). We evaluated cognitive performance in healthy eugonadal men and women before and again during GnRH agonist-induced hypogonadism. Men and women without medical or psychiatric illness were matched for IQ. Cognitive tests were performed at baseline (when eugonadal) and after 6-8 weeks of GnRH agonist-induced gonadal suppression.  During both eugonadism and hypogonadism, men performed significantly better than women on several measures of visuospatial performance including mental rotation, line orientation, Money Road Map, Porteus maze, and complex figure drawing.   Although some test performances showed an effect of hormone treatment, the majority of these differences reflected an improved performance during hypogonadism compared with baseline (and probably reflected practice effects). No significant differences in performance were observed across hormonal states in either men or women, nor were significant interactive effects of sex and hormone condition observed in any cognitive test domain. The well-documented male advantage in visuospatial performance, which we observed during eugonadal conditions, was maintained in the context of short-term suppression of gonadal function in both men and women. These findings suggest that, in humans, sex differences in visuospatial performance are not merely dependent on differences in current circulating sex steroid environment. Thus sex differences in visuospatial performance in adulthood could reflect early developmental effects of sex steroid exposure or other environmental exposures differing across the sexes as our data confirm that these differences are independent of circulating estradiol or testosterone levels in men and women.Finally, in our studies investigating the effects of ovarian steroids on HPA-axis function, we have confirmed our previous findings which employed exercise stress testing, that HPA axis responsivity is increased during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle in women. These findings also are consistent with our work in the Lupron paradigm that these luteal phase-related effects are mediated by progesterone.\n",

      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The loss of skeletal muscle mass is of clinical importance because it is associated with increased morbidity and mortality, as well as a marked deterioration in the quality of life. A broad patient population is affected by significant losses in muscle mass including those afflicted by various systemic diseases (cancer, sepsis, HIV- AIDS), chronic physical inactivity as a result of long term bed rest, rheumatoid arthritis and limb immobilization, and sarcopenia, the age associated loss in muscle mass and strength. Satellite cells are currently an attractive therapeutic target given their stem cell characteristics and essential role in post-natal muscle growth and regeneration. What remains controversial is the necessity of satellite cells in other aspects of muscle plasticity such as hypertrophy, re-growth following atrophy and muscle maintenance with aging. In an effort to resolve this fundamental issue, a novel mouse line was created which enables the specific ablation of satellite cells in mature skeletal muscle. The Pax7-DTA mouse will be used to investigate the physiological function of satellite cells in skeletal muscle hypertrophy (Aim 1) and re-growth following muscle atrophy (Aim 2). The results from the proposed experiments are expected to provide fundamental knowledge on the function of satellite cells in adult skeletal muscle plasticity which will help define the therapeutic value of satellite cells in treating the loss of muscle mass in various clinical conditions.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Loss of muscle, a common symptom associated with many chronic diseases, physical inactivity or aging, negatively impacts a person's quality of life, increases the susceptibility to other complications of disease and can even lead to death. Treatments designed to restore or prevent muscle loss have in part focused on using muscle stem cells referred to as satellite cells. The goal of the proposed research is to determine if satellite cells are necessary for adult muscle growth and thus, are an appropriate target for therapy for skeletal muscle loss.\n",

      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Patients with insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM; Type 1 diabetes) display higher bone loss and increased risk for osteoporosis and related bone fractures. However, the mechanisms that underlie bone loss in IDDM are still not fully understood. It is well established that bone mass is maintained by bone remodeling, a process that involves formation of new bone by osteoblasts and osteocytes and resorption of existing bone by osteoclasts. Bone remodeling is regulated by mechanical stimuli imposed continuously to the skeleton by physical activity, and proper response of osteocytes/osteoblasts to mechanical loading is thus essential for maintenance of bone function and skeletal integrity. The main goal of this R01 application is to test the novel hypothesis that altered expression of components of bone mechanosensory and transduction systems is a central mechanism leading to bone cell dysfunction and higher bone loss in IDDM. For this we will use comprehensive in vitro studies with bone cell lines that will be uniquely combined with in vivo bone physiology and in situ bone tissue analysis on the Type 1 diabetic Akita mouse model. The proposed in vitro studies will provide mechanistic insights into effects of high glucose on bone cell detection and response to mechanical stimuli. The in vivo and ultimate in situ studies with control age- matched and Akita mice treated with or without insulin will determine the impact of diabetes and associated high glucose on bone formation in response to mechanical loading, and evaluate the contribution of altered bone mechanosignaling to the higher bone loss in diabetes. These studies will be directed by a new investigator who has a background in biomedical engineering and has begun a first faculty appointment in a Department of Orthopaedic Surgery. Studies will combine the broad expertise of junior and senior researchers in the areas of biomedical engineering, pharmacology, physiology and molecular biology, and state-of-the-art biochemical, live cell imaging, histomorphometric studies and non-invasive in vivo whole animal bone imaging. The proposed studies are not only expected to advance understanding of mechanisms underlying diabetic osteopenia, highlighting the deleterious effects of high glucose on bone mechanosensory/transduction systems, but will also bring awareness to the importance of an early and tight glycemic control to prevent and reverse bone loss in diabetes.\n",

      "oa cartilage knee joint osteoarthritis articular acl chondrocytes progression chondrocyte\n",
      "--------------------\n",
      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common form of joint disease and a major cause of long-term disability in the United States (US). It is estimated that 2.5% of the adult population have symptomatic knee or hip OA. Over two-thirds of the 7.8 million OA patients in the US who seek treatment have moderate to severe joint involvement and would benefit from a therapy which arrests or delays cartilage loss. The etiology of OA is still partially unclear: While genetic factors are believed to underlie a significant proportion of OA cases, the majority of occurrences may not be genetically predetermined. OA is influenced by diet, body condition, or physical stress experienced (due to injury or overuse of a joint). Patient condition may therefore likely be improved or further progression prevented by an early identification of OA progression, combined with effective therapies. However, the current armamentarium of OA therapies merely relieves the inflammation and painful symptoms of OA but does not suppress the ongoing degenerative process. There is no known cure for osteoarthritis and further drug research is essential to help OA patients. Cartilage loss is believed to be the dominating factor in OA. While the standard radiography-based analysis method relies on joint-space width as a surrogate measure for cartilage thickness, an increasing body of literature supports the use of MRI as a primary imaging method to evaluate progression of osteoarthritis. MRI is able to directly measure cartilage volume and thickness. Being a three-dimensional imaging modality it allows, unlike x-ray projection images, for a localized analysis of imaging data in the full three-dimensional spatial context. Significant advances in MRI have resulted in the ability to quantify cartilage morphology and thereby provide a means to evaluate potential effects of pharmacologic intervention on OA progression. To aid drug development and to help subsequent regulatory approval, accurate, quantitative methods are needed to rapidly screen MR imaging data. To be time- and cost-effective, computer-assisted 3D image analysis is essential. However, most image-analysis methods for OA still require significant human intervention, precluding the comprehensive analysis of large databases as for example acquired by the Osteoarthritis Initiative. A strategy that has been beneficial in studies of the brain is the use of atlases to assist in data analysis. Following such success we propose the creation of population-based bone and cartilage atlases to facilitate bone and cartilage segmentation and to allow for localized data analysis by representing imaging data in a common anatomical coordinate system. We will use the developed methods to analyze cartilage thickness and to perform correlations with clinical variables. Developed software tools will be distributed in open-source form.\n",

      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality among patients with chronic kidney disease. This excess risk is only partly attributable to a high prevalence of traditional cardiovascular risk factors. The principal investigator's goal is to establish a career as an independent investigator with the broad objectives of understanding of the pathophysiologic mechanisms leading to cardiovascular disease and developing effective preventive strategies to reduce the burden of cardiovascular disease in kidney disease. The proposed study will investigate the mechanisms underlying development of cardiovascular disease in the earlier stages of non-diabetic chronic kidney disease utilizing data from two National Institutes of Diabetes & Digestive & Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) sponsored trials. The overall hypothesis is that: Non-diabetic chronic kidney disease is characterized by early elevation of markers of inflammation, oxidative stress and insulin resistance, and that these risk factors are associated with cardiovascular disease in this patient population.  The Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) Study was a large randomized controlled trial of patients in the earlier stages of chronic kidney disease. Participants in the MDRD Study had predominantly non-diabetic kidney disease of varying etiologies. The Halt Progression of Polycystic Kidney Disease trial is a randomized trial to slow the progression of kidney disease in patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). These two patient populations provide a unique opportunity to examine the relationship between kidney disease and novel cardiac risk factors, and to study the role of these novel risk factors in the pathophysiology of cardiovascular disease, in the absence of important confounders such as diabetes, dialysis and malnutrition.  The study hypothesis will be tested using three specific aims: 1. To determine whether inflammation, oxidative stress, insulin resistance, and endothelial dysfunction in the earlier stages of chronic kidney disease are associated with cardiovascular disease. 2. To determine whether ADPKD is associated with inflammation, insulin resistance, and oxidative stress 3. To determine whether inflammation, insulin resistance, and oxidative stress are associated with endothelial dysfunction, measured as brachial artery reactivity and peripheral artery tonometry, in ADPKD.  The novel risk factors under investigation in this proposal could serve to identify high-risk patients for targeted interventions to prevent or delay the adverse outcomes associated with cardiovascular disease. The applicant has chosen a group of distinguished mentors and collaborators to support this project. This award will provide Dr. Menon with the final training necessary for her to make the transition from trainee to principal investigator.\n",

      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This project is focused on determining how best to use sleep as an intervention to promote recovery from the biobehavioral risks posed by chronic sleep restriction. Chronic partial sleep loss due to medical conditions and social demands is common and associated with significant clinical morbidity. Our studies have shown that chronic restriction of sleep to between 4h and 6h per night results in neurobehavioral deficits that accumulate to levels equivalent to those produced by total sleep loss. We will undertake the first research to determine what aspects of sleep are critical for recuperation from the effects of chronic partial sleep loss. The issue of recovery of waking neurobehavioral and physiological functions will be addressed using an experimental approach that systematically determines the recovery potential of sleep in 180 healthy female (n=90) and male (n=90) subjects. Sleep duration will be varied parametrically on two consecutive nights, following 5 days of chronic sleep restriction. Key aspects of waking biobehavioral functions sensitive to sleep loss will be measured in subjects randomized to one of six sleep durations on recovery night 1 and one of six sleep durations on recovery night 2 (i.e., a total of 36 different combinations of sleep across the two nights). Statistically efficient response-surface modeling and dose-response regression approaches will be used for mapping recovery in neurocognitive, mood, and physiological outcomes as a function of sleep, using time in bed, total sleep time, and specific sleep physiological measures (e.g., REM sleep, slow wave energy in non- REM sleep) as independent variables. The resulting response-surface maps and dose-response curves will reveal the degree of recuperation of biobehavioral functions relative to varying amounts and types of sleep. These approaches also provide estimates of the variance attributable to gender differences, age effects, and differences in habitual sleep duration at home. The empirically estimated response-surface maps will be compared to predictions inferred from current biomathematical models of sleep-wake regulation, to assess how well these models predict recovery gained from sleep of different durations. In addition to providing the first dose-response curves for the relationship of sleep duration to recovery of waking functions, this project will explore the effects of varying sleep durations on cardiovascular markers in both women and men. The scientific data to be generated will advance theoretical understanding of sleep homeostasis; improve mathematical models of sleep-wake regulation; and inform questions of sleep need relative to public health.\n",

      "The number of people directly affected by diabetes continues to grow. In Washington State, 350,000 people are living with diabetes; another 150,000 are living with diabetes but have not been diagnosed. Some people in our state are affected by diabetes more than others. People with lower incomes and education levels are at greater risk to develop diabetes. These same individuals often do not have access to the diabetes education and health care needed to manage diabetes and prevent the complications often caused by uncontrolled diabetes. Research shows that treatments available today dramatically improve the management of diabetes and prevent long-term complications. The WSU Diabetes Awareness and Detection project has shown improvements in participants' knowledge and confidence to manage their diabetes and improvements in diabetes control as measured by A1c and blood pressure. The WSU Diabetes Detection and Prevention project will continue to offer diabetes awareness education classes in eight counties reaching three hundred individuals with diabetes in communities with high rates of diabetes. Medications are an important part of diabetes care.  But medications only work if people take them. , as stated by Robin Rubin PhD. People living with diabetes often have difficulty managing their medication plan. Initial results from On the Road to Living Well with Diabetes (OTR) program shows participants who report taking medications as prescribed have better management of their diabetes, measured by A1c and blood pressure. The WSU Diabetes Awareness and Detection project will work with Joslin Diabetes Center to explore ways to improve individuals' ability to comply with medication plan. The effectiveness of an educational booklet and lesson on medication adherence will be evaluated with 100 participants, in the OTR program. In Washington State 1.4 million people are affected by pre-diabetes. While education and management of diabetes helps reduce the burden of diabetes, the best way to reduce the impact of diabetes is to prevent pre-diabetes from developing into diabetes. Pre-diabetes is prevented by increasing physical activity and healthy food choices. In Washington, thirty-eight percent of the population does not meet the CDC recommendations for physical activity. Populations with lower education and income levels are less likely to attain the recommended levels of activity. Promoting physical activity at the community level has reduced the risks for developing diabetes and cardiovascular disease. The WSU Diabetes Detection and Prevention project will promote a community based walking challenge in eight counties to encourage regular activity; encourage families to exercise together, and to eat healthier foods. Communities across Washington are taking action to make it easier for residents to eat healthy and be more active. Individuals and organizations from a variety of backgrounds are working together to make healthier communities. WSU Extension is an important partner in this work and will continue to participate and promote Diabetes Awareness and Detection as a vital part of these efforts in five counties across the state.\n",

      "ï»¿   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    The regulation of gene expression dictates when, where, and to what degree protein isoforms are generated, thereby meeting the metabolic needs of various cell types that make up organs and living beings. Given the constantly changing microenvironment, this process is highly dynamic, capable of adjusting instantly to multiple external cues, or mounting gene expression responses within extended periods of time. To achieve diverse gene expression responses cells rely on multiple points of regulation that include modulating the origin and rate of transcription,altering pre-mRNA processing to induce the generation of alternatively spliced mRNA isoforms, changing the length or location of the 3' UTR through alternative polyadenylation, selective mRNA isoform translation, and altering the stability of mRNA pools. All of these gene expression steps are integrated and co-dependent. However, our understanding of the dynamic nature of gene expression is limited because most cell-based investigations analyze only steady-state levels of gene expression and because detailed analyses focus only on one of the multiple steps involved in representing a gene expression profile. This research application focuses on evaluating the dynamics of gene expression from pre-mRNA generation through RNA processing in the nucleus to translation and mRNA degradation in the cytoplasm with the long-term goal to chart the life span of all expressed mRNAs upon cellular transformation. We will test the hypothesis that alterations in the kinetics of gene expression steps set in stone unique gene expression programs that dictate cellular fate. Using novel metabolic labeling techniques we will track pre-mRNA dynamics in the nucleus (Aim 1) and mRNA dynamics in the cytoplasm (Aim 2) to develop a comprehensive understanding on the kinetic interplay that establishes steady-state gene expression patterns. Aim 3 will use this understanding and tools to determine to what degree alterations in the dynamics of gene expression steps contribute to the overall change in gene expression profiles that accompany Src-induced breast epithelial cell transformation. The experiments described will highlight how crucial the interplay between transcription, RNA processing and mRNA translation is for the development of altered gene expression programs. Furthermore, understanding the kinetics involved in establishing novel gene expression profiles may pave the way for novel therapies of human breast cancer. Throughout this project we will rely on our expertise in kinetics, RNA biology and bioinformatics to obtain complete kinetic profiles of gene expression unique to Src-induced breast epithelial cell transformation, thus producing a wealth of data useful to the gene expression and breast cancer research communities. The identification of breast cancer-specific gene expression events may be valuable for the development of novel early detection or prediction tools.\n",

      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The prevalence of obesity has grown to epidemic proportions and has been linked to severe health risks. In order for adequate treatments for obesity to be developed it must first be understood how obesity develops, what neural and physiological substrates are involved, and how external factors can influence it. The purpose of these studies is to use the diet-induced rat model of obesity to assess the neurological and physiological effects of exercise during the critical juvenile period of obesity development. Specifically, these studies will assess changes in food intake, body weight, and defense of body weight when juvenile rats are placed on a high fat diet and given free access to a running wheel and these aspects of energy homeostasis will be tracked through to adulthood. This model will mimic the onset of obesity in children who consume a high fat diet and participate in regular activity. In addition, these studies will focus on known neurological deficits in diet-induced rats and how exercise may serve to reverse these. The overall aim of these studies is to understand how exercise influences energy homeostasis and how exercise may serve to treat human obesity.\n",

      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This proposal seeks to identify the exact step(s) of adenovirus (Ad) infection that is (are) responsible for the initiation of an anti-Ad acute inflammatory response upon systemic virus application. Over the last two decades numerous Ad-based vectors have been developed for gene therapy applications and many are currently being tested in clinical trials. Most recently, interest in Ad has further expanded due to its potential as a vector for vaccination against life threatening infectious agents such as anthrax. While natural infections with Ad are largely harmless to humans, intravenous Ad administration may result in a severe inflammatory response, which can lead to fatal outcomes. It is currently recognized that the initiation of this acute systemic inflammation depends on interactions of the Ad capsid with host cells. Despite significant knowledge regarding Ad interactions with cells in vitro, the molecular mechanisms governing Ad bio-distribution, hepatic tropism and toxicity in vivo remain poorly understood. Recently, we identified a novel blood factor-dependent pathway of Ad liver cell infection in vivo. This finding explained the observed Ad biodistribution in animals after systemic application and is fundamental for the development of novel strategies to modify both Ad tropism in vivo and virus-associated toxicity. In mouse models, we will analyze the innate immune response to intravenously applied capsid-modified Ad mutants deficient in their ability to undergo the initial steps of virus infection. Our specific aims are to analyze the role of Ad interactions 1) with primary attachment receptors; 2) with integrins, which facilitate Ad initialization; or 3) with cellular factors upon virus escape from endosomes, in the initiation of an anti-Ad inflammatory response. Based on the data obtained, in our fourth specific aim we will construct ah Ad vector ablated for binding to known virus receptors and capable of infecting cells via an alternative receptor, LDLR. By applying this vector in mice and evaluating its toxicity we will test the hypothesis that modification of the Ad capsid represents a feasible approach to reduce acute Ad-mediated inflammation while preserving virus gene transfer ability upon systemic application. These studies will significantly improve our understanding of fundamental mechanisms of the host defense against viral pathogens and may ultimately lead to the development of safe and efficient Ad vectors for the therapy of a wide range of inborn and acquired human diseases.\n",

      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Stress is a powerful stimulus that modulates animal behavior and the functioning of the nervous system. In people, stress negatively impacts a variety of psychiatric conditions relevant to the clinical mission of the Department of Veterans Affairs, including depression, anxiety and substance abuse. In particular, exposure to severe stress is associated with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), both in military and civilian populations. These conditions are a major health issue for our veteran population and available treatments are at best partially effective. There is a pressing need to better understand the effect of stress on the functioning of the brain in order to design better treatments for stress related disorders. Studies in humans and animals have indicated that the amygdala is a brain region involved in mediating the behavioral responses to stress, and patients' with PTSD show elevated activity in this brain region. In particular the basolateral complex of the amygdala (BLA) is critical to normal and pathological amygdala functioning. The BLA's response to stress has been shown to involve synaptic plasticity of the excitatory, glutamatergic connections within this brain region. While complex synaptic plasticity is a complex phenomenon, many studies have indicated that it involves the NMDA and AMPA subtypes of glutamate receptor, as well as the signal transduction protein CaMKII. Manipulations that block the activity of these proteins block behavioral responses to stress. There is evidence that the response of these proteins to altered activity levels and stress involves altered patterns of localization. It is the goal of this proposal to study this issue in more detail using immunohistochemical localization of the NR1 and GluR1 subunits of the NMDA and AMPA receptors and CaMKII and high resolution electron microscopic examination. We will use a rodent model of repeated, severe stress- repeated immobilization stress to study the effect of stress in the BLA. We will begin by determining the time course of how stress alters the localization of these proteins in the BLA. We will next use an in vitro system to assess how these proteins are affected by altered activity patterns in the BLA and how prior stress exposure modifies the amygdala's response to activity. Finally, we will use post-embedding immunogold labeling to study how stress affects the composition of the postsynaptic density in the BLA.  These studies will provide a detailed understanding of the molecular architecture of excitatory neurotransmission in the BLA and determine how this is altered by prior stress exposure. This information will enhance our understanding of stress affects in this critical brain region and suggest possible molecular targets for novel therapies for stress related disorders, including PTSD.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     Stress plays a significant role in modifying behavior and may lead to, or worsen, a variety of psychiatric conditions relevant to the clinical mission of the Department of Veterans Affairs.  Stress can precipitate or worsen episodes of depression and a variety of different anxiety disorders.  Stress is associated with worsening symptoms in schizophrenia.  Stress is associated with relapse in alcohol and drug abuse and dependence.  In particular, we now recognize that severe stressors can be associated with the development of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in both civilian and military populations.  These conditions afflict large numbers of our veteran population.  Substantial resources have been committed to the care of these patients, and further, these disorders can increase a patient's use of healthcare resources for other medical problems.  While importance of stress and stress related illnesses is clearly established, our treatments remain partially effective at best.  Here we propose research to better understand the effect of stress in a critical brain region, the amygdala.  The amygdala is a brain region involved in PTSD and the brain's response to stress.  Stress has been shown to alter the circuitry and functioning of the amygdala.  In this proposal we will investigate how the organization of key molecules, involved in excitatory communication in the amgygdala, is altered by stress.  The results of the proposed studies will further our understanding of stress induced changes in the amygdala and suggest specific molecular targets for new drug treatments for stress related disorders, including PTSD.\n",

      "Background:  Metastasis is the most dreaded outcome of breast cancer.  Once breast cancer becomes metastatic clinically, it is virtually incurable.  Efforts to prevent and effectively treat metastasis therefore rank among top priorities in breast cancer research.  Such efforts however are significantly hampered by our lack of understanding of the mechanisms of metastasis.  Breast cancer metastasis is a multi-step process.  Targeting breast cancer when it begins to acquire metastatic potential or at the earliest signs of metastasis clinically represents a great window of opportunity to completely thwart and thereby cure metastatic breast cancer.  Towards this end, we have performed deep sequencing of nine pairs of synchronous bilateral breast cancers.  We find the majority of synchronous bilateral breast cancers are clonally related, i.e., the result of  breast to breast  metastasis.  There are a limited number of mutations that are acquired when a mother tumor metastasizes to the opposite breast to form a daughter tumor.  According to  Invasion to Metastasis Cascade,  this circumscribed spectrum of genomic changes may reveal the underpinnings of the initial steps of breast cancer metastasis.  Identification of candidate metastasis genes and elucidation of their functional involvement in cancer biology may produce novel prognostic instruments and novel therapies to prevent or eradicate metastasis.Overarching Challenges:  Our proposal addresses the important question why some breast cancers develop life-threatening metastasis aiming to eliminate mortality associated with breast cancer metastasis.Objective/Hypothesis:  For the majority of synchronous bilateral breast cancers that are clonally related, i.e., the result of  breast to breast  metastasis, we postulate that there is need to incur only a very limited spectrum of genomic changes.  This is due to the lack of need for spreading breast cancer cells to acquire genetic changes to adapt to non-breast, foreign environment.  No prior exposure to systemic therapy also obviates the need for acquiring therapy resistance.  Reduced complexity significantly increases our chance of meaningful discoveries.Specific Aims:Aim 1:  Collect and perform deep sequencing of bilateral synchronous breast cancers, and matching negative axillary nodes if available, from patients without pre-operative systemic treatment.  Establish clonal relationship and identify mutations that are acquired when mother tumors give rise to daughter tumors in  breast to breast  metastasis and study the evolutionary dynamics that govern the process to identify when the metastasis occurs.Aim 2:  Use breast cancer cell lines to study the metastasis related phenotypes of mutations identified in Aim 1.Aim 3:  Use mouse models with limited metastasis to study the function of mutations identified in Aim 1.Study Design:  We have completed deep exome sequencing of nine pairs of synchronous bilateral breast cancers and found six of them are most likely the product of  breast to breast  metastasis.  Our preliminary analysis finds a limited number of changes, and now with recurring patterns, in homologous genes or pathways, suggesting a limited number of potential mechanisms mediating  breast to breast  metastasis.  We will perform complete genome sequencing of ~40 more sets of synchronous bilateral breast cancers, each with an uninvolved axillary node as a germ-line negative control.  Driver mutations will be confirmed with the targeted capture panels for sequencing at much greater depth.  We will establish the clonal relationship of the tumors from the two sides and in the case of  breast to breast  metastasis, the genomic changes associated with that spread.  The presence of select changes can be further verified by targeted re-sequencing.  Focusing mutations affecting protein-coding functions, we will perform manual curation and pathway analysis to identify (homologous) genes or functions or pathways that are (recurrently) mutated in  breast to breast  spread.  The functional involvement of these candidate metastasis genes, either individually or in a pooled  competition  assay, will be characterized in cell culture and in animal models.  Loss of function mutations can be created with shRNA-mediated suppression of expression or CRISPR mediated gene disruption.  Gain of function mutations can be mimicked by overexpression of cDNA after site-directed mutagenesis or recapitulated via introduction of the identified mutations via CRISPR-mediated genome editing.  The ability of these genomic modifications in altering index breast cancer cell lines' metastasis-related phenotype in vitro will be examined.  Candidate metastasis genes will be further characterized in animal models.  67NR and 4TO7 are nearly isogenic cells that readily form tumors in syngeneic BalB/c background but display minimal metastatic potential.  These cell lines can be injected into mammary fat pads of appropriate hosts to form orthotopic models.  The effects of mutations on primary tumor growth in situ, tissue tropism, and growth of distant metastatic deposits will be studied.  The effects of mutation in MB-231 cells in a lung colonization model will be investigated.Impact:  Our work will lead to better risk stratification and optimal therapy selection in the adjuvant setting and development of novel effective therapeutics to prevent or treat breast cancer metastasis.\n",

      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Wound-healing complications are an important health concern that can be associated with diabetes, bed sores, and infection. The inability to form a stable provisional matrix over the wound site is a common hallmark of poor wound healing. Without a stable matrix, the migration of inflammation responsive cells such as endothelial cells, neutrophils and macrophages, needed to produce new blood vessels1 and fight infections is not possible. The goal of this project is to develop an imaging method to quantify the stability of theprovisional matrix during early-stage wound healing. This biological process has been largely invisible and the proposed work is expected to provide significant insight into molecular events that delay wound healing. Wound healing involves an intricate set of precisely timed processes that begin with the formation of a fibrin clot, followed by an inflammatory response, and eventually ending with extensive tissue remodeling and wound closure. During the inflammatory response, the provisional matrix is produced in part through the action of transglutaminase (TG) enzymes cross-linking plasma proteins such as fibrinogen and vitronectin. Recent work in our laboratory has shown that administration of infrared fluorescent-labeled substrates for the TGs, including both proteins and peptides, produces strong contrast for in vivo imaging.2 In this R21 project we will test whether our method can identify problems associated with unstable matrix formation in animal models by executing the following Specific Aims: (1) develop imaging strategies to support multiple time-point imaging in the healing cascade; (2) evaluate the performance of the multiple time point optical imaging method in vivo in a mouse model; and (3) compare provisional matrix stability through imaging matrix formation in a delayed wound healing model of the diabetic mouse. Multiple time-point imaging can monitor problems with both matrix formation and degradation processes. Slow matrix formation will be associated with poor incorporation of labeled substrate into the wound compared with controls. Excessive matrix degradation will be associated with rapid loss of labeled substrates in the wounds compared with controls. A successful project will lead to a new imaging method for studying wound healing and evaluating wound- healing response. In the near term, this method would be used in animal model studies to evaluate the wound- healing process and support the development of new approaches to promote wound healing. In the longer term, this method would be extended to clinical studies to identify the mechanisms of compromised healing and help in wound management. Furthermore, because similar cross-linking processes are involved in atherosclerosis3 and cancer,4 this imaging method will also find broader applications beyond wound healing.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Wound healing is a tremendously important process in human health, with a wide range of implications in diseases such as diabetic ulcers, bed sores, infection, and cancer. This proposal describes a method for optically monitoring the progress of the wound-healing process by probing the formation of the provisional matrix that provides a scaffold for migration of immune and endothelial cells. The proposed method should prove invaluable for research on wound healing in animal models and evaluation of new drugs, and will provide vital information for diagnosing and treating conditions involving abnormal or compromised wound healing.\n",

      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Radiation exposure from a nuclear accident or potential terrorist attack can cause death from acute injury or from late effects of radiation. Studies of the survivors of the atomic bomb at Hiroshima reveal that many radiation-induced deaths occurred years after the exposure. Some medical treatments are available or are under development to treat the acute radiation syndrome. Because radiation causes apoptosis of some cell types, blocking apoptosis may limit acute radiation injury. In contrast, no effective countermeasures exist to mitigate the late effects of radiation exposure. Furthermore, it is not clear how interventions that prevent the acute radiation syndrome, such as blocking radiation-induced apoptosis, may alter the spectrum of late effects years after radiation exposure. For example, it is conceivable that blocking apoptosis to limit acute injury could inadvertently increase late morbidity and mortality from radiation. In this proposal, we will use sophisticated mouse genetics to dissect the mechanisms of radiation-induced carcinogenesis and vascular injury following a single exposure to radiation. Moreover, we will determine the long-term sequellae of blocking radiation-induced apoptosis. The ultimate objective of these studies will be to provide a foundation of pre-clinical data to develop safe and effective medical products to prevent acute and late effects of radiation. In this proposal we will use mouse genetics to determine whether temporary inhibition of p53 or the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis exacerbates late effects of radiation such as radiation-induced cancers and vascular injury. These in vivo studies will provide a mechanistic foundation for the design of safe and effective countermeasures against radiation that do not inadvertently increase late effects of radiation.\n",

      "--------------------\n",
      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic nonmalignant pain is highly prevalent, and is associated with substantial personal suffering, lost productivity, and healthcare costs. Use of opioid analgesics for management of nonmalignant chronic pain has increased dramatically, yet is fraught with controversy due to associated side effects and abuse potential. Moreover, the analgesic efficacy of opioid analgesics can vary widely between individuals. Given the increasing use of opioid analgesics for the management of chronic pain, we aim in this project to improve understanding of factors that influence opioid analgesic effectiveness, and which may have relevance to understanding opioid risks. Possible predictors of individual differences in responses to opioid analgesics include traits of negative affect and emotion regulation, sex, experimental acute pain sensitivity, circulating levels of the endogenous opioid agonist beta-endorphin (BE), and efficiency of conditioned pain modulation (CPM). A common mechanism that may explain how these diverse factors could all predict opioid analgesic responses is endogenous opioid system function. We propose that traits of negative affect and emotion regulation, sex, acute pain sensitivity, plasma BE levels, and CPM may reveal direct effects on opioid analgesic responses, but may also exert influence indirectly via associations with functioning of endogenous opioid antinociceptive systems. We will use controlled laboratory methods to assess acute pain responses in 120 chronic low back pain (LBP) patients and 120 healthy controls across three sessions using a randomized, counterbalanced design: under placebo, opioid blockade (naloxone), and opioid agonist (morphine). Aim1 is to determine the degree to which an index of endogenous opioid function (opioid blockade effects on pain responses) is related to exogenous opioid analgesic effects, and to compare these associations in LBP patients to those shown in healthy people. This will be an innovative test of the hypothesis that better endogenous opioid function (larger opioid blockade effects) predict greater exogenous opioid analgesia. Aim 2 is to determine: a) the degree to which negative affect and emotion regulation traits, sex, acute pain sensitivity, resting plasma BE levels, and CPM are related to exogenous opioid analgesic effects (total effect); and b) the degree to which these factors are related indirectly to exogenous opioid analgesic effects via differences in endogenous opioid function (blockade effects) (mediation). Aim 3 will explore relationships among opioid side effects, indicators of opioid abuse potential, opioid analgesic efficacy, and endogenous opioid function. Results could improve not only theoretical understanding of how these potential markers for poor opioid analgesic response may operate directly versus through a common endogenous opioid mechanism, but eventually permit clinical characterization of likely costs/benefits of opioid-based pain management a priori for a given patient. In addition, results may suggest interventions that could directly target common pain modulatory mechanisms underlying these predictive factors.\n",

      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Human infants are confronted with a complex world that is filled with ambiguity. Not only are many different features and dimensions of information present in the environment, but these cues are often unrelated to any reinforcement or feedback. There are two solutions to learning in a complex and ambiguous environment: (a) innate constraints on the cues selected for processing (bottom-up), or (b) rapid learning-to-learn mechanisms that assess cues (top-down). Learned top-down mechanisms of information selection may be tuned more to specific task demands, and thus more useful for learning. Given how much infants have to learn over the first two years of life, it is not efficient to use mainly slow but precise (top-down) search methods. My hypothesis is that the developmental progression of learning how to learn requires using bottom-up information in a systematic way, while creating top-down buffers against bottom- up distraction. The experiments in the research plan will test this hypothesis, with each experiment evaluating an additional level of learning. Sophisticated behavioral techniques (i.e., both table- and head-mounted eye- tracking) and complementary state-of-the-art neuroimaging methods (i.e., functional near-infrared spectroscopy [fNIRS], measuring spatially-localized neural activation via non-invasive light probes on the scalp), as well as data mining tools applied to infant eye movement data, will examine how infants learn to learn from both computer displays and in naturalistic settings. There are four specific aims in this research program: 1) to establish a new, robust measure of learning with both behavioral and neural measures, 2) to investigate how attentional deployment can optimally improve learning, 3) to apply the learning paradigm to the natural environment, and 4) to conduct microanalyses on and to develop computational models of infant eye movements. The training component focuses on learning to use two state-of-the-art methods in infancy research (a head-mounted eye-tracker and fNIRS), and learning to use innovative data mining tools to analyze patterns of infant eye movements to link looking behavior to cognitive abilities. This training program is essential for the applicant's career goal of identifying the optimal strategies for learning to learn that will lead to training regimens for populations with learning difficulties. The findings will benefit researchers within the larger community of developmental science, as well as artificial intelligence, perceptual learning, education, animal learning, machine learning, and evolutionary psychology. This work will contribute to a foundational understanding of the dynamics of selective attention and learning in typical development, which in turn would inform populations with learning difficulties.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This multi-disciplinary research program will indicate signatures of optimal attentional deployment for efficient learning among distractions via converging evidence from behavioral and neuroimaging methods and data mining tools. This work will contribute to a foundational understanding of the dynamics of selective attention and learning in typical development, which in turn would inform populations with learning difficulties.\n",

      "ï»¿   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is becoming clear that collective cell migration is involved in the dissemination of tumor cells. In collective cell migration, cells move through migration of cohesive multi-cellular units, the specifics of their motility depend on numerous factors including cell-cell, cell-matrix interaction, adhesion strength, extracellular matrix rigidty, organization of the cellular cytoskeleton etc. How each individual factor affect the collective cel migration is still poorly understood and needs further investigation. This project will investigatefundamental mechanisms of collective cell migration from cell molecular biology perspective as well as from mechanics viewpoint. The research objective of this proposal is to establish a multiscale approach to investigate cell-cell, cell-matrix interaction and their influences on collective cell migration. The central hypothesis of the proposed research is that collective cell migration depends on interactions between cells and their microenvironment which can be quantified by biomechanical and biophysical parameters in an integrated multiscale model. To test the hypothesis, computational modeling and simulation approaches will be developed and three specific aims will be addressed: Aim 1 To build an active cell model with internal structures to capture the essential features of cell membrane, cytoskeleton and cell nucleus: In Aim 1, we propose to use liquid crystal and liquid crystal elastomers to model major cell components. Aim 2 To develop a mutliscale cell migration model and to elucidate how different factors control collective cell migration motions: In Aim 2, we propose to use coarse-grained potential forces to model the cell-cell/matrix interaction. After the model validation, we will systematically study how cell-cell/matrix interaction, adhesion strength, extracellular matrix rigidity, organization of the cellular cytoskeleton will affect collective cell migrations motions.Aim 3 To develop advanced simulation techniques for cell mechanics simulations: In Aim 3, a total Lagrangian meshfree formulation will be developed and a related Galerkin weak formulation will be derived for numerical computation. The main advantage of adopting a meshfree Lagrangian formulation is its ability to avoid remeshing and easy-tracking of cell surface and interface. It i anticipated that the multiscale model can capture the essential features of collective cell migration. As a result, it will significantly enrich our knowledge in some fundamental theories in cell mechanics and it will provide a theoretical underpinning for study of cell-cell interaction an tumor metastasis mechanisms.\n",

      "Identification of functional variants is an end-game of analysis of genetically influenced diseases and a starting point to understand roles of genes in behaviors. Public databases are populated with >22 million sequence variants, mostly single nucleotide polymorphisms. However, most rare and uncommon variants are unknown, and functionality of most is unknown. Through a combination of in-vivo and in vitro functional genomics studies we have discovered several functional loci and demonstrated their roles in complex behaviors relevant to alcoholism and addictions. We discovered or helped define in vitro and in vivo effects of a series of functional polymorphisms altering behavior. In alcoholism, an OPRM1 Asn40Asp missense variant (Bergen et al, 1997) was shown by others to be functional and linked to naltrexone treatment response (Anton et al, 2008). A common, functional LA->LG SNP in the serotonin transporter HTTLPR locus (Hu et al) enhanced linkage to behaviors and intermediate phenotypes. These include SSRI response of depressed patients (Hu et al, 2007), neuroimaging responses to emotion, and gene x stress interactions leading to suicidality (Roy et al, 2007).  Common HTR2C Ser23Cys (Lappalainen et al) and HTR2A Asn452His alleles (Ozaki et al) were detected and shown to be functional, and linked by others to behavior, including clozapine response. In first-episode schizophrenics, we found that a functional DRD2 promoter polymorphism influences antipsychotic response (Lencz et al, 2006). We traced linkages of functional loci and haplotypes of NPY (Zhu et al, 2008), GCH1 (Tegeder et al, 2006) and DISC1 (a series of papers beginning with Hodgkinson et al, 2004) to various behaviors including emotionality, schizophrenia and clinical pain outcome. By deep sequencing we found an HTR2B Stop codon that is relatively common in Finns, absent in other populations, and associated with but not determinant for impulsive behavior. This stop codon also cosegregated with impulsive behavior in families, and the mouse gene knockout was more impulsive and higher in novelty seeking. As an example of the type of molecular studies performed with polymorphisms listed in this paragraph, the HTR2B stop codon led to variable nonsense mediated decay of the HTR2B RNA and blocked expression of the receptor (Bevilacqua et al, Nature, 2010).  A low expression Neuropeptide Y (NPY) haplotype increased anxiety and emotionality but had stronger effects on molecules (NPY RNA and protein) and intermediate phenotypes (brain imaging measures of responses to emotional stimuli and pain/stress) than complex behavior. (Zhou et al, Nature, 2008). Intermediate phenotypes augment genetic analyses of behavior. The imaging genetics paradigm we helped initiate (Heinz et al, 2000; Hariri et al, 2002; Egan et al, 2001; 2003; Zubieta et al, 2003)  has continued to yield groundbreaking findings. With collaborators at NIDA, we helped discover that the mechanism of action of CHRNA5 Asn398, the major functional locus from nicotine GWAS,  involves weakening of a Dorsal Anterior Cingulate/Ventral Striatal circuit, the weakness of which predicts nicotine craving in smokers with and without other psychiatric diagnoses (Hong et al, 2010). Clinical subphenotyping enabled linkage of HTR1B to antisocial alcoholism (Lappalainen et al), serotonin transporter (SLCA4) to anxiety (Mazzanti et al; Hariri et al), BDNF Val66Met to episodic memory (Egan et al), COMT Val158Met to anxiety (Enoch et al), executive cognition (Egan et al; Lipsky et al; Malhotra et al), and pain threshold (Zubieta et al; Diatchenko et al), and GTP cyclohydrolase to chronic pain and experimental pain response (Tegeder et al). In these studies brain imaging and cognitive measures play prominent roles. Frontal cognitive deficit is a risk factor in schizophrenia, alcoholism and other diseases. Dopamine generally enhances prefrontal cortical efficiency. Met158, a common COMT variant, leads to four-fold reduction in COMT activity. It is thus a candidate allele for cognitive function via effect on frontal dopamine. We found an allele-dosage relationship of Met158 to frontal cognitive function and diminished frontal cortical efficiency (Egan et al). The relationship to cognition is observed in populations differing in baseline cognitive function: schizophrenia, moderate-severe head injury (Lipsky et al), & controls (Malhotra et al). We proposed that Val158 has a counter-advantage: stress resiliency. In two populations Met158 predicted anxiety in women and decreased frontal EEG coherence (Enoch et al), and Met158 was associated with lower resiliency to pain/stress (Zubieta et al; Diatchenko et al). Met158 predicted inability to activate endomorphin release after pain/stress (Zubieta et al). Overall, effect sizes of genes in intermediate phenotypes is larger (Goldman and Ducci, 2007) and as illustrated by effects of genes such as NPY (Zhou et al, 2008), COMT (Zubieta et al, 2003) and CHRNA5 (Hong et al, 2010) on intermediate phenotypes.Linkage, gwas and RNA-seq are representative of genomic, hypothesis-free approaches. Linkage disequilibrium of alcoholism to GABRA2 was found at the Chr 4 GABAA subunit cluster we implicated by family linkage (Long et al). We showed the association was anxiety- modulated (Enoch et al). Another GABAA gene cluster implicated in alcoholism and alcohol response is located on Chr 5. Within this cluster we reported linkage disequilibrium to alcoholism (Radel et al) and that GABRA6 has a missense variant associated with alcohol dependence and response to alcohol and diazepam (Iwata et al, Schuckit et al). A family linkage scan yielded genome-wide significant linkage of CRH-BP (a stress-related protein) to an alcoholism-associated EEG trait and this was followed by association of CRH-BP to EEG in two populations. (Enoch et al). Our gwas of EEG (Hodgkinson et al, PNAS, 2010) in a relatively small sample of Plains Indians detected three independent genome-wide significant loci, and we replicated two loci (including one locus that was just sub-threshold) in a second population (Hodgkinson et al, PNAS 2010). We recently used next-generation sequencing to analyze brain histone methylation and transcriptome changes resulting from early maternal deprivation in Rhesus macaques (Barr et al, in preparation) and effects of chronic cocaine and alcohol in human brain (Zhou et al, PNAS 2010). The latter study found distinct differences between the gene networks that are regulated by chronic drug exposure in people, as compared to those detected in acute and subacute exposures in animal models.Founder populations, extreme probands, and exposed populations enhance power to detect gene effects. Our Finnish dataset is derived from a founder population and ascertained from criminal alcoholic probands & thus enriched for Type II early onset alcoholism. SW and Plains Indian samples represent founder populations. An African American substance dependence sample with high adversity exposure revealed GxE of childhood adversity and HTTLPR in suicidality (Roy et al, 2007). Stress and poverty, but not African ancestry, predicted high risk of addictions (Ducci et al, 2009). An MAOA VNTR previously linked to dyscontrol via stress interaction was linked to outcomes of alcohol dependence and ASPD in American Indian women, of whom half had been sexually abused as children (Ducci et al, 2008). A strong interaction between the MAOA VNTR and testosterone was observed in the Finnish criminal sample (Sjoberg et al). As mentioned, deep sequencing in Finns detected a population-specific  HTR2B Stop codon significant for impulsive behavior (Bevilacqua et al, Nature, 2010).\n",

      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Liver diseases are among the 10 leading causes of death in the United States. The liver's extraordinary regenerative capacity is critical to understanding the mechanisms leading to developmental defects, acute and chronic liver diseases, and liver carcinogenesis. Stimulation of hepatocyte proliferation while preventing apoptosis is essential to the liver's regenerative process. Recently we uncovered a tumor suppressor pathway has potent effects upon liver cell division and death. Our long range goal is to define the cellular mechanisms underlying liver regeneration in health and disease and to apply these findings to developing improved therapies for liver disease. To that end, we are uniquely capable to address the objectives of this application, which are to uncover the mechanism that leads to the novel tumor suppressors' profound effects upon the liver. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that: The tumor suppressor controls liver celgrowth factor pathway in controlling liver size. At the end of the study we will better understand the growth and death of liver cells. This will help develop treatment for many liver diseases such as liver transplantation, cirrhosis, acute and chronic hepatitis.  Project Narrative: The objectives of this study are to uncover a newly recognized very potent molecular system that controls the growth and death of the liver cells. Unlocking how this pathway works will help develop treatment for many liver diseases such as liver transplantation, cirrhosis, acute and chronic hepatitis.\n",

      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Identifying genetic mechanisms that are protective or detrimental to age-dependent events would have profound consequences for preventing or delaying age-related functional declines. Studies on rare heritable human disorders and targeted gene mutations in rodents demonstrate that both the rate of age-related changes and longevity can be modulated through genetic mutation in single genes. In particular, there is a critical role of longevity genes that modulate hormonal, metabolic, and cellular insult repair pathways for the rate of aging in model organisms and potentially also in humans. While the genetics of aging has been predominantly studied in dividing peripheral tissues in relation to senescence, or in the context of neurodegenerative disorders, here we propose to explore a less studied area,  normal  human brain aging. We present a concise approach to defining age in the human central nervous system (CNS) using postmortem DNA microarray. This approach is based on the observation that gene expression correlates of aging are progressive and continuous throughout the adult life. This observation allows for evaluation of  age-trajectory , which we define as the deviation of molecular brain age from chronological age (a measure of rate of aging). We employ this approach to test our hypothesis that each of five single nucleotide polymorphisms in three putative human longevity genes will alter human  age-trajectory  and will have partially overlapping mechanisms. These candidate genes (snps), the serotonin 1B receptor (G861C), sirtuin 5 (prom1,2,3), and klotho (KL-VS) were selected for their potential relevance to modulation of human CNS aging and for the translational extension of our work on accelerated CNS aging in serotonin receptor 1B knock-out mice. We use human postmortem DNA microarray datasets to characterize age sensitive transcripts in two brain areas relevant to our specific interest in the intersection of aging and affect, Amygdala and Anterior Cingulate Cortex. We then propose to evaluate by genotypic two-group comparison, our five candidate snps effects on the transcriptome, age-trajectory, and specific age-sensitive transcripts in these .two brain areas. This study provides useful previously uncharacterized information on transcriptional changes with age. It then harnesses this basic information to investigate the mechanistic relationship between putative longevity genes and molecular brain age-related correlates. This will provide insight into CNS aging mechanisms and entry points into the potential interaction of genetics of  normal  aging with vulnerability to age-related CNS disorders.\n",

      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   The National Institute of Diabetes, Digestive, and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) established the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort Study in 2001. The principal goals of the CRIC Study are to examine risk factors for chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression (i.e. further loss of kidney function) and cardiovascular events among patients with varying severity of CKD, and develop predictive models that will identify high-risk subgroups with CKD. The latter results will target enrollment of high-risk subjects into future treatment trials and increase application of available preventive therapies. Hypertension treatment has been the most effective intervention altering the course of renal function loss in CKD. However, the drugs used in the treatment of hypertension differ in their benefits on renal function. This raises the possibility that blood pressure reduction by itself only partly explains their beneficial effect and beckons a broader understanding of vascular adaptation to diseases such as CKD. Determination of the pulse wave velocity (PWV) a reflection of large vessel stiffness has provided useful information in cardiovascular disease epidemiology.\n",

      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The ovarian steroid hormones, estradiol and progesterone, regulate cellular functions in the central nervous system resulting in changes in physiology and reproductive behavior in a variety of species. P effects in the brain are primarily mediated through the  classical  genomic mechanism of action via classical intracellular progestin receptors (PRs) to modulate target gene expression. Increasing evidence suggests that P effects are also mediated via  non-classical  pathways to induce rapid activation of protein kinase-mediated extranuclear, intracellular signal transduction cascades. It is also becoming apparent that these rapid signaling events  cross talk  with the classical PR-mediated mechanisms to mediate P action. However, the receptor mechanisms mediating the rapid effects and cross talk are not well understood. We have reported P-initiated rapid activation of kinases, PKA, PKC and CaMKII in P sensitive regions of the brain. Preliminary data suggest that this rapid signaling by P activates G proteins and subsequent downstream cytoplasmic signaling molecules. We hypothesize that these rapid effects could be mediated by novel membrane receptors. The signal amplification achieved by these cascades could enhance the level of cross talk with classical PRs, facilitated by scaffolding proteins, within the neuronal cells to regulate brain and behavior. This proposal focuses on the determination of the  non-classical  mechanisms of P action that extend beyond the classical intracellular steroid receptor- mediated pathways. In particular, we propose to determine the biochemical and molecular events underlying the rapid P- activated signaling pathway(s) in P-sensitive areas of the rat brain. Specific aim 1 will identify the mechanism underlying the rapid P activation of G proteins and the downstream signaling pathways in vitro. Specific aim 2 will examine the in vivo functional relevance of G protein-mediated mechanisms in P- mediated signaling and behavior. Specific aim 3 will test the hypothesis that a scaffolding protein integrates the rapid extranuclear signaling pathways with the intracellular PR-mediated genomic pathway in brain and behavior.\n",

      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Imbalances in neurohumoral control, especially those leading to excessive sympathetic efferent neuronal activation, are associated with adverse short- and long-term alterations in cardiac function - including cardiac arrhythmias and pump failure. As a corollary, stabilization of such imbalances within select components of the cardiac neuronal hierarchy can reduce the arrhythmic substrate, maintain myocyte viability and prolong survival. Thus, the primary objective for this competitive renewal is to first determine the role of interdependent interactions within and between central and peripheral components of the cardiac neuronal hierarchy and secondly how such linkages remodel in response to acute and chronic cardiac stress (e.g. myocardial ischemia/infarction). As the intrinsic cardiac nervous system represents the final common integrator of cardiac control, this organ component of the cardiac neuronal hierarchy represents a primary focus for targeted neuromodulation therapy. We hypothesize that chronic myocardial infarction/ischemia remodels the peripheral (intrinsic cardiac and extra cardiac intrathoracic) nervous system, thereby contributing to both the genesis of cardiac arrhythmias and deterioration of contractile function. We further hypothesize that targeted neuromodulation mitigates ischemia-induced remodeling of the intrinsic cardiac and extra cardiac intrathoracic nervous systems, thereby reducing the substrate for cardiac arrhythmia formation while sustaining contractile function. This grant exploits the opportunities afforded by electrical neuromodulation via spinal cord stimulation (SCS), a clinical therapy with recognized anti-antiginal properties - a therapeutic approach that has potential for management of both i) arrhythmias and ii) congestive heart failure. Central nexus points within the cardiac neuronal hierarchy will be stimulated electrically (dorsal T1-T3 SCS) to modulate the intrinsic cardiac nervous system to impact regional cardiac electrical stability and support contractile function. Specific aim 1 will determine a) how regional atrial electrical events are coordinated by the intrinsic cardiac neuronal activity such that excessive activation of its select nerve inputs lead to atrial arrhythmias and b) if chronic SCS modifies cholinergic and noncholinergic synaptic interactions within the intrinsic cardiac nervous system to reduce this arrhythmogenic potential. Specific aim 2 will determine a) if chronic myocardial infarction/ischemia remodels the intrinsic cardiac nervous system such that this atrial arrhythmogenic neuronal substrate becomes enhanced and then to test the capacity of b) chronic SCS to modify synaptic interactions within the intrinsic cardiac nervous system in the suppression of atrial arrhythmias. Specific Aim 3 will determine if chronic myocardial infarction/ischemia adversely remodels intrinsic cardiac and extra cardiac intrathoracic autonomic neural function, thereby contributing to deterioration of cardiac mechanical function and, if so, whether chronic SCS mitigates such changes.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Interactions between central and peripheral aspects of the cardiac nervous system play a major role in control of the normal and stressed heart. Imbalances within this system are associated with deleterious effects including abnormal heart beats, sudden cardiac death and heart failure. The fundamental concept underpinning this proposal is to: 1) understand the interdependent interactions occurring within and between central and peripheral components of the cardiac neuronal hierarchy; 2) to determine how such linkages remodel in response to chronic cardiac stress (e.g. myocardial ischemia/infarction); and 3) to determine what are the optimum therapeutic strategies to target select elements of the cardiac nervous system to mitigate the progression of congestive heart failure and the potential for sudden cardiac death.\n",

      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the first two funding cycles of this grant, we have characterized the molecular structure and function of Cutaneous Lymphocyte Antigen or CLA. We have also made the surprising observation that in humans, the vast majority (>90 percent) of CLA+ skin homing T cells are not in peripheral blood, but rather are in skin at any given time. These cells appear to enter skin directly from blood, through constitutively expressed E selectin, chemokine ligands, and LFA-1 on dermal microvasculature. These observations suggest that memory responses in skin to antigens originally encountered through skin may not require acute extravasation of circulating memory T cells. To more fully define the immunophysiology of these phenomena, we have used murine models of cutaneous infection with vaccinia virus to track a T cell mediated, antigen-specific immune response from draining lymph node and subsequently to both skin as well as other peripheral tissues and secondary lymphoid tissues. These observations provided us with a model of how cutaneous immunization leads to both a robust skin homing response via imprinting of effector memory T cells in draining lymph node, as well as a vigorous systemic response, by migration of subset of central memory T cells throughout the body. In the next five years, we propose to further dissect antigen specific T cell trafficking after cutaneous infection as means to better understand the biology of skin homing T cell trafficking and recirculation through skin. Using gene deficient mice, we will explore the role of the skin homing molecules that discovered were important in the last grant cycle, including PSGL-1, CD43, and FucTVII. We will use parabiotic mouse models to test hypotheses about the trafficking of T cells from skin to LN, blood, and ultimately back to skin. Finally, we will use these models to discover mechanisms and the kinetics of T cell migration through skin. Taken together, these studies will allow us to test clinically important hypotheses about the biology of skin homing T cells. Understanding the biology of these cells is central to modifying their function in the course of treating human diseases. Moreover, because many vaccines are delivered through skin, understanding how such cutaneous responses lead to systemic immunity will help us improve the quality and impact of modern vaccine therapy. PROJECT NARRATIVE: A better understanding of how skin homing T cells are generated after skin immunization, and how memory T cells enter and exit skin, is critical for developing better treatments for skin diseases. It is also critical for development and optimization of vaccines, the majority of which are given via skin immunization. Knowledge generated from this grant application over the next five years will have a significant impact on both areas.\n",

      "ï»¿   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Memory decline affects millions of people during normal aging and as a consequence of mental health disorders like schizophrenia and chronic depression. This study is concerned with answering the question of how the processing of information in working memory, a form of short-term memory in which information is actively maintained and flexibly used to achieve goals, influences the formation of long-term memories. Several models (Miyaki & Shah, 1999) presume a separation between working and long-term memory, but new evidence suggest an overlap in the neural substrates that subserve these two memory systems (Henke 2010, Nee & Jonides, 2011). Recent data (Ranganath & D'Esposito 2001, Axmacher et al 2007) show the hippocampus, important for long-term memory consolidation, is also active during high load working memory (i.e., when many items are maintained). We propose to test the hypothesis that working memory load predicts long-term memory formation. In Aim 1, we will ask subjects to maintain complex visual scene stimuli in working memory while varying load, and test their recall after different retention intervals. This will answer how working memory load influences memory consolidation and identify a specific variable (load) that governs the interplay between two memory systems. In Aim 2, we will adapt the behavioral paradigm to conduct a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study to assess the mechanism of interaction. Does increased hippocampal activity and functional connectivity with cortex during high load working memory processing predict subsequent long-term memory recall? The results will provide new insight into how two memory systems previously studied mostly in isolation interact, and identify a specific variable and mechanism by which information in working memory is transferred to longer-term stores. The results will also inform strategies to improve memory (e.g., through training) during normal aging and disease.\n",

      "Developing a Computer-Adapted Test for PTSD Background : PTSD has been a major concern among veterans for many years, and is increasingly prominent with thousands of veterans now returning from deployment in Iraq and Afghanistan. Among Vietnam veterans the estimated lifetime prevalence of PTSD is 31% for men and 27% for women. Identification and early treatment of PTSD can prevent it from becoming a chronic condition accompanied by serious impairment in functioning. Consequently, it is important for the VHA to be able to identify veterans who need treatment for PTSD as well as evaluate outcomes of treatment. A wide range of PTSD screening and assessment measures are available, but results vary depending on which measure is used. Most existing PTSD assessment instruments follow the 17 diagnostic criteria described in the DSM-IV diagnostic manual for psychiatric disorders, although many other items that are not specific to PTSD are also included in existing assessment instruments. Creation, testing and implementation of a Computer-Adapted Test (CAT) for PTSD will identify the most sensitive and discriminating items from among dozens of items on existing measures, allowing for reliable and valid assessment of both presence and severity of PTSD with very few items. Our proposed PTSD CAT (P- CAT) will go beyond existing efforts by bringing a patient-centered approach to PTSD assessment by adding items reflective of additional PTSD subdomains identified in the self-report assessment literature and confirmed by our preliminary research that were noted by veterans as important in assessing PTSD, but are not among the diagnostic criteria. We will build on the work accomplished by our short-term project which conducted the preliminary research needed for this IIR submission. Objectives: Objectives are to: 1) create and test a PTSD CAT that will be useful for assessing the presence and severity of PTSD symptoms at a given point in time following traumatic exposure, and longitudinally over time to monitor course and/or outcomes of treatment; 2) develop a static, short-form PTSD assessment instrument composed of the most discriminating informative items for use in situations where computer administration is not practical; 3) validate both the CAT and short forms of the instrument using three other widely used paper and pencil self-report measures of PTSD severity as well as clinical diagnoses; and 4) assess sensitivity to change over time for both versions of the instrument. Methods: We will first administer the items to a sample of 1,000 veterans, stratified by age/cohort (Vietnam, OEF/OIF) and gender. We will use an established survey company that has worked with other VA research groups to obtain a representative probability-based sample. A 2-parameter graded response Item Response Theory (IRT) Model will be used to calibrate the PTSD items for incorporation into the CAT. Tests of unidimensionality will be done to determine whether the PTSD CAT is essentially unidimensional or multi-dimensional. Tests of differential item functioning will be performed to determine whether given the same level of PTSD severity, item responses differ as a function of cohort, gender or type of traumatic exposure (combat or other). The PTSD CAT will be validated against three established reliable and valid self-report PTSD measures, as well as against a clinical diagnosis of PTSD. Anticipated Impacts: Development of a PTSD CAT will facilitate and enhance VA's capacity to: 1) provide a mechanism for efficient, reliable and valid monitoring of the course of PTSD and the outcomes of its treatment; 2) assess the severity of PTSD symptoms in veterans 3) efficiently and accurately identify veterans suffering from PTSD and 4) expedite the processes for referral and entry into appropriate, evidence-based treatment programs.\n",

      "NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY Remarkable levels of sophistication have been reached in linking properties of a given material to its microstructure, crystal structure and electronic structure. A substantially bigger challenge, though, is predicting the dynamic evolution of a material taken out of equilibrium and determining what external stimuli must be imposed to shepherd the material into a desired end state. The desirable properties from a particular chemistry are usually manifested in metastable crystal structures and microstructures rather than in the true equilibrium state of that chemistry. In many applications it is necessary to know how a material in a particular state will evolve over time either because it is metastable or unstable, such as in high temperature applications, or due to changing boundary conditions, as in electrochemical energy storage applications.This award supports computational research and education to develop highly automated statistical mechanical software tools that will be used to predict materials properties and greatly enhance the ability to design materials for high temperature and non-equilibrium applications from first principles. Areas where such tools will prove invaluable include the design of new (i) structural materials for aerospace applications and large-scale power generation plants, (ii) electrode and electrolyte materials for electrochemical energy storage, (iii) materials for thermoelectric applications and (iv) materials for shape memory applications. The project will also involve the education and training of graduate students in computational materials science, a field that is increasingly recognized as invaluable in the design and rapid implementation of new materials.TECHNICAL SUMMARY  This award supports research and educational activities aimed at extending the existing thermodynamic and kinetic foundations that underpin phenomenological descriptions of non-equilibrium processes in the solid state. This will be realized by two activities: (i) the development of statistical mechanical computational tools to automate the calculation of a wide variety of thermodynamic and kinetic properties that are essential in the description of materials evolving out of equilibrium and (ii) the development and application of new statistical mechanical theoretical methods to enable the prediction of high temperature properties of multi-component crystalline solids. A deep understanding of many high temperature materials and non-equilibrium processes is hampered by a lack of not only quantitative thermodynamic, kinetic and mechanical data, but also a lack of knowledge about qualitative trends in this data. Furthermore, a large class of technologically important high temperature materials cannot be adequately described and understood with current statistical mechanical methods. This research activity will result in highly automated computational statistical mechanical tools to predict free energies and transport coefficients as a function of concentration. Such tools will provide new knowledge about the dependence of a wide variety of materials properties on chemistry and crystal structure. The theoretical focus on high temperature phases will generate fundamental new insights about the vibrational stabilization mechanisms, atomic hop mechanisms and mechanical properties of a large and important class of poorly understood materials used in high temperature applications.  The project will also involve the education and training of graduate students in computational materials science, a field that is increasingly recognized as invaluable in the design and rapid implementation of new materials.\n",

      "spinal sci cord injury motor recovery bladder cervical locomotor functional\n",
      "--------------------\n",
      "Few injuries are as physically and psychologically devastating as suffering a spinal cord injury (SCI).  Each year, over ten thousand North Americans suffer such an injury and are left permanently paralyzed, with limited to no movement of their arms and/or legs and a myriad of other health impairments such as bowel and bladder incontinence.  Unfortunately, there are no treatments available that unequivocally reverse this paralysis and improve neurologic recovery.  Much research has been done to develop novel therapies for SCI in the laboratory.  While these are promising, it will still be many years before the completion of clinical trials that test their effectiveness in human SCI.  This is little comfort to those who are injured today, particularly in combat situations where advanced and sophisticated neuro-restorative therapies may simply not be deliverable.  There is therefore an urgent need for treatments that can be more rapidly translated into the clinical setting to improve neurologic recovery in individuals who have suffered an acute spinal cord injury.Our research proposal aims to inform current treatment guidelines around the blood pressure management of acute SCI.  Blood pressure management in acute SCI is important because after traumatic injury the spinal cord's blood supply is reduced below critical levels, making the cord vulnerable to further irreversible ischemic injury.  Physicians attempt to improve the blood supply by increasing systemic blood pressure for the first week post-injury.  Current practice guidelines recommend using intravenous fluids and vasopressors to maintain the mean arterial pressure (MAP) at 85-90 mm Hg for 5-7 days post-injury in all acute SCI patients.  These guidelines, however, are not based on strong clinical evidence from high-quality clinical trials.  By promoting a  one-size-fits-all  approach, such hemodynamic guidelines ignore the possibility that the spinal cord and its blood flow respond differently depending upon whether the cord remains compressed or has been surgically decompressed after a period of prolonged compression lasting hours to days.The ultimate goal of our research is to inform clinical guidelines around the hemodynamic management of acute SCI patients by determining how alterations in systemic blood pressure influence the injured spinal cord before and after surgical decompression.  Our overall objective is to determine how hemodynamic support of systemic blood pressure in the presence or absence of spinal cord compression affects the vascular, metabolic, biochemical, and behavioral outcomes of traumatic SCI.  It is our hypothesis that increasing the blood pressure to improve blood supply to the injured spinal cord is helpful when the cord remains compressed, but, paradoxically, has deleterious effects when the cord is surgically decompressed.  Our pilot data using a large animal model of SCI have suggested that increasing the blood pressure after decompression leads to dramatically increased swelling of the spinal cord and an exaggerated metabolic response.  Such deleterious effects were hinted at many years ago, but these warnings have to some extent been overlooked in our current enthusiasm for driving up the blood pressure.To shed further light on the downstream effects of hemodynamic support, we will use a novel pig model of SCI that shares many anatomic and physiologic similarities with human SCI.  The pig spinal cord is much more similar in size to the human cord than the rat or mouse spinal cord.  Similarities in the pig spinal cord blood supply with that of humans have made it a routinely used animal model for studies of ischemic spinal cord injury.  Using our large animal model of SCI, we hypothesize that well-intended increases in MAP will exacerbate a so-called  reperfusion injury  and ultimately have deleterious effects on regions of the spinal cord surrounding the injury site.  Our experiment will evaluate both short-term (24 hours post-injury) and long-term (12 weeks post-injury) outcomes of MAP support before and/or after spinal cord decompression has occurred.Ultimately, a better understanding of how the spinal cord adjacent to the injury site responds to alterations in systemic blood pressure in the presence or absence of residual mechanical compression will help clinicians provide optimal hemodynamic management for patients with acute SCI and improve their chances of neurologic recovery.  This research has potential application to all patients with acute SCI, and importantly is relevant to front-line clinicians who are charged with managing these individuals and doing whatever possible to maximize their chances of neurologic recovery.  Blood pressure management is one of the few aspects of clinical care in acute SCI that physicians currently have some control over, and so it is highly relevant to seek ways of optimizing this management.  We do not discount the importance of novel and cutting-edge neuro-regenerative therapies -- clearly, these will be needed to advance the field of SCI research in the future.  However, we contend that work such as that which we propose is important to understand how we could potentially improve the delivery of care today.\n",

      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): During periadolescence, mammals display specific patterns of social behavior, termed social play behavior or rough-and-tumble play. Social play is a natural reinforcer, and it is thought that social play is of major importance for social and cognitive development. Despite its importance, the underlying neurobiological mechanisms of social play are largely unknown. Because social play is a reinforcer, it is likely that the neural substrates underlying natural and drug reinforcement also play a prominent role in the regulation of social play behavior. Interestingly, periadolescence, the period in life that social play is most abundant, roughly corresponds to the age that individuals will start experimenting with drugs of abuse. Thus, the study of the effects of drugs of abuse on social play behavior can serve two purposes: it will help to elucidate the neural substrates of social play behavior and it will show how periadolecent drug use impacts on social interactions and hence, social development. With regard to the relation between social behavior and drug abuse, there is a wealth of evidence that antisocial personality traits predispose to the development of drug abuse. There have not been many animal studies to investigate this topic. Therefore, the present proposal aims to investigate 1. The effects of drugs of abuse on social play behavior in periadolescent rats, 2. The neuropharmacology of the rewarding and motivational aspects of social play in rats and 3. Whether individual social characteristics of rats can predict subsequent drug self-administration and impulse control. The present proposal aims to study the brain processes involved in social behavior in young rats and the effects of drug use on social interactions in young rats. By changing the quality of social interactions, drugs of abuse can have a major impact on the development of brain and behavior. We will also study whether individual differences in social behavior can predict the vulnerability to subsequent drug abuse, thus allowing for animal research to investigate the neural and behavioral underpinnings of the well-known predictive value of antisocial personality traits for later drug abuse.\n",

      "--------------------\n",
      "Donor-specific transplantation tolerance, as defined by graft acceptance after discontinuation of immunosuppressive therapies, can be achieved in specific pathogen-free rodents but rarely in humans. Deletion, anergy and suppression of alloreactive T cells are 3 cellular mechanisms most often associated with the induction of transplantation tolerance in mice. It has been shown that deletion of alloreactive T cells and suppression of remaining alloreactive T cells by CD25* regulatory T cells (Tregs) are necessary for the induction of transplantation tolerance by costimulation blockade. However, whether T cell anergy is necessary and/or sufficient for the induction and/or the maintenance of transplantation tolerance is not known. Furthermore, it is not clear if these 3 mechanisms of T cell tolerance (and others potentially) need to be coinduced simultaneously for tolerance to be robust and maintained long-term successfully. If they do need to be co-induced, the usual lack of development of transplantation tolerance in humans could be due to the inability of current immunosuppressive regimens to induce/maintain these 3 pathways concurrently. Our preliminary experiments indicate that tolerance is not an all or none phenomenon and that a readout of allograft acceptance is not a sensitive measure of the functional robustness of transplantation tolerance. Indeed, we observed that depletion of Tregs or blockade of PD-L1 does not abrogate established tolerance, but is able to precipitate acute cardiac allograft rejection in tolerant mice that had been previously infected with Listeria monocytogenes but retained their graft. This suggests that the quality or quantity of mechanisms that maintain graft acceptance are modified after infection and that a simple lack of acute rejection does not inform on the stability of the tolerant state or how close the alloimmune response is to the rejection threshold. We propose that  transplantation tolerance  is a continuum of states in which the number and intensity of anti-inflammatory processes that constrain alloimmunity are progressively eroded by pro-inflammatory signals (infectious episodes or others) until a rejection threshold is reached. Although intuitive, this concept has not been investigated in any systematic manner and has important implications in clinical transplantation: it may explain why patients who achieve transplantation tolerance, i.e., years of stable function without immunosuppressive drugs, or even patients stably maintained with minimal immunosuppression, may suddenly reject their grafts; the robustness of the tolerance level may also determine whether immunosuppressive drugs can be withdrawn and whether tolerance can persist. We specifically hypothesize that a state of transplantation tolerance that Is robust and that can persist and resist Inflammatory insults may only be achieved when T cell depletion, T cell regulation and T cell anergy are all co-induced simultaneously and optimally. Insights gained from these mechanistic analyses will be of importance in the clinic, where the genetic diversity of the transplant population all but guarantees that individuals receiving the same treatment will develop different degrees of deletion, anergy and suppression. This hypothesis will be tested in the context of the following specific aims: Aim 1: To determine the requirement for T cell anergy in the induction and maintenance of transplantation tolerance. Aim 2: To assess the necessity and sufficiency of T cell mechanisms of tolerance in the establishment of robust transplantation tolerance.\n",

The Center will conduct interdisciplinary, community-based minority health and health disparities research by studying the pathways to disparities in health outcomes with an emphasis on familial factors, acculturation, and gender. The Southwest Interdisciplinary Research Center's (SIRC) provides the foundation upon which the new center on health disparities will be established. Founding the Exploratory Center will strengthen Arizona State University's (ASU) capacity as a national leader in the U.S.-Mexico border region to advance health disparities research and make a significant contribution to advancing DHHS' initiatives for eliminating health disparities in the Southwest. The proposed center's mission is to produce and apply scientific findings leading to the improvement of minority health and the reduction of health disparities by advocating the unfettered access to culturally competent health/behavioral health prevention, services, and treatment for minority populations. The Exploratory Center expands health disparities research from proximal causes of morbidity and mortality to fundamental causes of disease and related cultural processes which act as protective or risk factors. This will be achieved by identifying and ameliorating the pernicious constraints that emerge from the interaction of poverty, language barriers, race, ethnicity, gender, and cultural norms within unresponsive systems of care. The center's research projects and its administrative, research, training and community engagement/outreach cores aim to prevent, reduce and eliminate health disparities within the following DHHS identified special emphasis areas and determinants: HIV/AIDS, mental health, and substance abuse. The three focus areas will be studied throughout the prevention-to-services continuum with a special emphasis on understanding their comorbidity and their effect on the health outcomes of the historical ethnic communities of the Southwest (Mexican Americans & American Indians) and two fast growing racial minority populations in the region, African Americans and Asian Americans.\n",

      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Peripheral sensory neurons are responsible for detecting chemical, thermal and mechanical stimuli in the skin. Their ability to recognize and process these touch sensations is influenced by the territories in which their peripheral arbors innervate the skin, how they connect in the central nervous system, and their ability to relay information to downstream circuits. Defects in any of these components can result in a range of debilitating disorders collectively known as peripheral neuropathies. Extensive research has gone into cataloguing the different subtypes of sensory neurons based on the expression of specific molecular markers. However, the mechanisms by which sensory neuron subtypes identify process and transmit different kinds of sensory information are still largely unknown. We have discovered that two subclasses of peripheral sensory neurons in zebrafish larvae can be distinguished by their pattern of axon projection into the central nervous system: some terminate in the hindbrain, whereas others terminate within the spinal cord. I propose to study how these sensory neurons' projection patterns correlate with their peripheral axon territory selection strategy, their behavioral function, and their pattern of activation of downstream interneurons. These studies should together provide insight into how neural circuits distinguish between sensory inputs. Aim 1: To characterize the territory selection strategy of a specific sensory neuron subtype. Aim 2: To determine if different subtypes of sensory neurons elicit distinct behavioral responses. Aim 3: To identify interneurons activated by specific subtyes of somatosensory neurons. Peripheral neuropathies can occur as secondary effects of various disorders and/or their treatments, while in most cases, they are idiopathic. Disease based trials of therapeutic drugs have advanced the treatment of certain peripheral neuropathies, but because somatosensory neurons are molecularly and functionally heterogeneous, effective treatments for one neuropathic disorder will not necessarily have the same effect for other disorders. Treating these disorders will require knowledge of how different sensory neuron subtypes process and discriminate sensory inputs.\n",

      "Our recognition of the fundamental mechanisms mRNA expression, exemplified by the regulated expression of HIV, provided the basics for our interest in developing preventive HIV DNA based vaccine strategies. Attractive features of the DNA platform lie in its simplicity, versatility, stability, with repeated administration without vector immunity, being a non-replicating vaccine and not association with adverse effects. Several DNA vaccines are currently in clinical trials against HIV and cancer, and there is a licensed DNA vaccine against dog melanoma. We are testing immunogenicity of SIV and HIV DNA vaccines in mice and selected DNA candidates advance to the macaque model. Some of our successful candidates have been moved to clinical trials. Because intramuscular injection of DNA induces relatively low immune responses in macaques and humans, we are testing additional delivery methods, including in vivo electroporation and liposomes. We reported that electroporation dramatically increased the efficiency of DNA delivery in naive macaques, leading to greatly augmented antigen expression and resulting in the induction of highest levels of T cell responses. Our DNA vaccine includes the cytokine IL-12 DNA (expressed from optimized DNA) as adjuvant and we reported increased magnitude and quality of the responses. Importantly, we reported the dissemination of the DNA vaccine induced T cell responses to mucosal sites including rectal and vaginal mucosa, the portal of entry of HIV. We also found that DNA induced immune responses show extraordinary longevity in vaccinated macaques detectable for several years after the last vaccination. DNA vaccination elicits moderate humoral immune responses in macaques. Using DNA-only vaccination, we found that our optimized DNA vaccine vectors are able to induce potent immune responses able to protect from high viremia. We showed that a protein boost can induce higher levels of Ab. We found that co-delivery of DNA+protein, using either unadjuvanted or adjuvanted protein, in the same muscle at the same time increased antibody production and mucosal dissemination. DNA+Protein co-immunization is superior to vaccination with either of the two individual components in eliciting humoral immune responses. Combination of DNA+Protein induces potent humoral responses able to significantly delay or prevent virus acquisition and improve virological control of the highly pathogenic SIV challenge. To optimize vaccine-induced immunity and efficacy of the DNA+protein co-immunization vaccine regimen, a SIVmac251 based vaccine was compared using two TLR-4-based liposomal formulations as adjuvants (TLR-4+TLR-7 or TLR-4+QS21) in macaques, which resulted in induction of robust humoral immune responses with qualitative differences. Vaccinees were preferentially infected by SIVsmE660 transmitted founder T/F virus carrying the neutralization resistant A/K mutation, demonstrating a strong vaccine-induced sieve effect. SIVsmE660-specific systemic neutralizing antibody and mucosal antibodies targeting V2 region of Env correlated with delay in acquisition of the neutralization-sensitive virus and. V2-specific antibodies and cellular SIV-specific T cell responses contributed to control of viremia. Although both DNA+protein vaccine groups show delay of virus acquisition, the TLR4+7 adjuvanted vaccine induced stronger protective responses resulting in lower peak and chronic viremia. We are further exploring approaches to improve immunogenicity targeting the V2 epitopes to induce more effective responses. We also compared immunogenicity and protective efficacy of a DNA+Protein vaccine delivered following two different strategies: co-administration in the same site or separate delivery of DNA and protein in opposite anatomical sites. We found that the co-immunization induces higher vaccine-induced Env Ab and T cell responses. Importantly, only the co-immunization group showed significant delay in SHIV acquisition with a 67% reduction in per exposure acquisition risk relative to the controls after 15 weekly intravaginal challenges. These data indicate that simultaneous recognition of the two vaccine components (DNA and protein) by the draining lymph node plays a critical role in the development of protective immunity. We are identifying correlates of protection from disease development, which will provide critical information to further improve our vaccine approaches. The advantage of co-immunization vaccine regimens targeting immunogens to the same draining lymph node could be applicable to other vaccine modalities and other pathogens.\n",

      "--------------------\n",
      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term objectives of this research plan are to combine approaches of neuroanatomy, cellular biology and mouse behavior tests to probe for mechanisms regulating optic nerve regeneration and restoring vision after injury or diseases. Optic nerve damage is a major feature of several blinding diseases, such as glaucoma, optic neuropathy, and trauma. Finding ways to rescue retinal ganglion cells from degeneration and to promote optic nerve regrowth are crucial to the development of efficacious treatment for these conditions. Previously, using the established model of optic nerve axotomy and mouse genetic technology, we identified two barriers to optic nerve regeneration the loss of Bcl-2 expression and maturation of astrocytes and their acquisition of the ability to form glial scars. By eliminating these two barriers demonstrated for the first time successful optic nerve re-elongation into the brain targets, up to postnatal day 14 (P14) in mice. Interestingly, regenerating axons in the postnatal mice entered the wrong (ipsilateral) side of the brain and innervated the visual targets in there. However, the regeneration fails consistently if the injury is incurred after P14, suggestion development of additional barriers to nerve regrowth at this age. The key remaining questions are: (1) what is the additional barrier to optic nerve regeneration that is developed after P14 and whether successful regeneration of the severed optic nerve can be achieved in the adult, and (2) whether regenerated axons are capable of establishing a topographic map and functional synapses with target neurons and in turn restoring vision. Recent studies in my laboratory implicate that appearance of the third and likely the last barrier to optic nerve regeneration is related to the development of CNS myelin. We hypothesize that the three barriers to optic nerve regeneration include the loss of Bcl-2 expression by retinal ganglion cells, development of glial scars, and appearance of CNS myelin; simultaneous elimination of the three barriers will allow optic nerve regeneration and restoration of vision in the adult. The three specific aims of this research plan includes: (1) To determine if simultaneous eliminating the three barriers to retinal ganglion axonal regrowth will enable optic nerve regeneration in the adult. (2) To determine a role for EphB1 in directing the ipsilateralization projection of retinal ganglion cell axons during regeneration, using the model of EphB1 knockout mice. (3) To investigate whether regenerated RGC axons are capable of establishing topographically ordered functional connections that can lead to vision restoration, using neuroanatomy, visual evoked potential, and animal behavioral tests. The results of this study may lead to a novel strategy for using neural transplantation to treat blindness and other CNS diseases.   Project Narrative: Failure of optic nerve injury to be repaired is a major feature of several blinding diseases, including glaucoma, optic neuritis, and multiple sclerosis, as well as trauma. Our present research plan is proposed to identify and alleviate all barriers to optic nerve regeneration. The results of these proposed studies will open the door for future development of treatment strategies for optic nerve damage after disease or injury.\n",

      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Although most patients are believed to have mild-to-moderate asthma that responds to inhaled corticosteroids, there are subpopulations of asthma patients with severe disease whose symptoms and control are largely unresponsive to treatment including systemic corticosteroids. Severe asthma affects 10% of all asthmatic subjects, but these patients have greater morbidity and a disproportionate need for health care support. The mechanisms of severe asthma are not determined, but respiratory infections cause the majority of asthma exacerbations and have profound and potentially long-lasting, effects on asthma including its severity and response to treatment. In attempting to evaluate mechanisms of severe asthma, striking similarities exist between features of severe asthma and the response to respiratory infections in asthma, including intensity of airflow obstruction, neutrophilic inflammation, and a diminished response to corticosteroids. These parallel features suggest that mechanisms of severe asthma may be related, at least in part, to similar events associated with respiratory infections. Rhinovirus infections have begun to emerge as principal contributors to many phases of asthma including inception and exacerbations and possibly severe asthma. It is speculated that respiratory infection effects on asthma severity are complex, multicellular and, in part, the result of a dysregulated immune response that allows RV to persist as an airway infection. Thus, it is hypothesized that severe asthma is caused, in some patients, by an infection with strains of rhinovirus resulting in changes in the airway milieu to create a phenotype shift in macrophages towards an alternatively activated population with reduced anti-viral actions to further a persistent infection, inflammation and obstruction. To test this hypothesis, the Systemic Triamcinolone in Asthma Characterization study will be applied to subjects with severe asthma compared to well-controlled asthma, to determine whether the differences are related to underlying corticosteroid therapy. The contribution of airway and parenchymal abnormalities to airflow limitation will be determined along with anatomic (imaging) changes in the lung, to correlate these changes with rhinovirus infections and inflammation. RT-PCR Multicode technology will be used to detect rhinovirus in respiratory tract samples and evaluate the effects of an infection on characteristics of severe asthma including inflammation through virus generation of cytokines and chemokines. Finally, the phenotype (classically activated vs. alternatively activated) and function (inflammatory vs. repair) of airway macrophages in severe asthma will be determined and their contribution to severe asthma determined. These studies will provide new insights into the mechanisms of asthma, particularly severe disease, and possibilities of new approaches to treatment.\n",

      "--------------------\n",
      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal will study a recently recognized form of hearing disorder called auditory neuropathy (AN) that is due to a disorder of auditory nerve functions in the presence of normal cochlear receptor activities. AN subjects have normal measures of cochlear outer hair cell activities but abnormal measures of the central auditory pathway functions beginning with auditory nerve. The hearing disorder typically affects speech comprehension out-of-proportion to the pure tone loss, particularly speech recognition in noise. AN is not rare and accounts for 10 percent of newborns identified as having hearing loss and also develops in childhood and in adults. In adults the disorder of auditory nerve is commonly associated with a peripheral neuropathy. In addition, AN and sensory hearing loss occur together. Loss of neural synchrony and decreased auditory nerve input are proposed as cardinal mechanisms underlying the hearing disorder. The sites of abnormality along auditory nerve have recently been identified at auditory ganglion cells and their axons (Type I AN) or distally in the auditory periphery where auditory nerve terminals, inner hair cells, and the synapses between inner hair cells with nerve terminals are in close approximation (Type II AN). Our long-term goals are to understand the underlying mechanisms of AN and the accompanying hearing impairments to provide a scientific basis for alleviating the hearing deficit in AN subjects. We propose four experiments using both psychophysical and electrophysiological techniques that will help us achieve these goals. We will characterize (1) the reorganization of central auditory pathway occurring in response to altered auditory nerve input; (2) the contributions of dysynchronization and decreased auditory input as pathophysiological mechanisms underlying AN; (3) the objective physiological and psychophysical measures of improved auditory temporal processes in cochlear implanted AN subjects, and (4) the improvement of speech recognition using new auditory processing techniques. The results of our studies could have major impact on the diagnosis, classification, understanding, and treatment of auditory neuropathy.\n",

Strengthening research is therefore an institutional obligation to which the college is fully committed. Criticalis development of highly skilled and motivated researchers backstopped by an effective research support base. Lack of an institutional research support structure has been recognized as a major barrier towards sustainable research capacity development in the college. This has become more evident as internationalization of research has increased competition for the limited pool of research funding. To effectively compete for funding and ensure quality research, the UZCHS needs to develop its research administration that will provide the base good grant management and support to researchers and students, ensuring the regeneration of research capacity. The proposed Institutional Research Administration Capacity Building (IRAC) Plan places priority on developing research administration capacity as a pre-requisite for broader research skills building and support for the research enterprise. This will be achieved primarily through the strengthening of a Research Support Centre (RSC) through training of the Extramural Associate and other RSC and departmental support staff in research and grants administration. The plan also includes the training and support for researchers and students to enhance awareness and appreciation of research, generate research interest in students and junior faculty, and develop requisite skills for grant application and conduct of research. The RSC will coordinate the various activities that will range from grant administration through clinical trials support, research training courses, data management and research information services. The UZCHS has committed to ensuring synergies of the proposed project with other research and capacity building initiatives in the college. The main objectives of the IRAC are to: Strengthen research administration through distance and residency training at NIH and other funding and research institutions; Strengthen grants administration through targeted training of RSC and other staff in the college; Strengthening the research information system at RSC to ensure effective identification of funding and training opportunities, timely provision and easy access to relevant research information; Enhancing the research knowledge and skills, especially of junior scientists through appropriate short research training course (grant writing,research methods, data management etc) thereby enhancing ability to develop good quality proposals and employ good research practices in implementing their projects; Strengthening the research governance framework in order to engender a culture of research; Providing data management and clinical trial support services; Reaching out to other organizations for establishment of networks of excellence in research administration. These objectives will be achieved through a variety of interlinked and synergistic activities that involve training, technicl support and provision of the necessary equipment. The IRAC is for a period of five years and is estimated to cost about $235,000.00.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Developing research administration capacity is critical for effective and sustainable overall research capacity building in the UZCHS. The capacity building will enable the college to create a culture of research underpinned by effective and efficient utilization of its human and material resources that will facilitate and sustain indigenous scientiic leadership that conducts nationally relevant research. This is imperative with the ever increasing shift by funding agencies from targeting individuals to rely more on institutional accountability o research funds.\n",

      "Depression is a common psychiatric illness that often begins in adolescence and adds to high mental health costs in the United States. Some depression can be normal and short-lived, but having a depressive disorder in adolescence can lead to other mental illnesses such as anxiety disorders, substance abuse, and suicide in adolescence and adulthood. Thus, it is important to study depression during adolescence in order to identify risk factors for depressive disorders before functioning is impaired. The ways in which the body physiologically responds and adapts to stress has been linked with the development of depression. Little is known how these biological processes work in Mexican-origin youth, which is important given that Mexican-origin adolescents show higher rates of depression symptoms and diagnoses relative to peers of other racial/ethnic groups and suicide is the third leading cause of death among 10-20 year old Hispanics in the U.S. If it is not treated early, depression can lead to 1) repeated school absences/inability to finish school; 2) impaired peer relations; 3) low self-esteem; 4) alcohol/drug use; and 5) problems adjusting in the workforce. Despite this importance, depression in Mexican-origin youth has been understudied, particularly from a neurobiological perspective. It is only recently that non-invasive neuroimaging methods have been available for scientists to safely study neurobiology involved in depression. Using neuroimaging techniques and other methods to assess physiology in humans allows for a tighter integration between animal and clinical research on depression, provides a better understanding of the development of depression, and helps create better treatments for depression. This project will examine neurobiological data (e.g., brain function, immune function, cardiovascular physiology, and stress reactivity), psychiatric symptoms and diagnoses, and reports on family, peers, behavior and functioning in Mexican-origin adolescents who have elevated depressive symptoms. This approach will address new questions about the relationships between the brain and social contexts in the development of depression. If a specific profile of neurobiological functioning is associated with the symptoms of depression, then such assessments might be helpful for identifying youth with high risk for depression. The project&#39;s results will be analyzed, evaluated, and interpreted to provide informational sessions and workshops for parents, teachers, and clinicians as well as local mental health service providers and schools about depression and associated risk factors in youth.\n",

      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The primate visual system analyzes incoming visual information according to a sparse set of fundamental features. Feature-selective neurons provide a detailed analysis of the local features in visual scenes, such as information about stimulus orientation, motion direction, and so forth. The neural representation of visual features has been studied extensively in non-human primates but has proven challenging to study in humans due to the limited spatial resolution of noninvasive neuroimaging methods. My lab has developed novel analysis techniques to measure the feature tuning properties of the human visual system using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Our preliminary studies show that different stimulus orientations and motion directions evoke distinct patterns of ensemble fMRI activity in the human visual cortex that can be reliably classified by statistical algorithms. This project will apply this novel pattern analysis approach to investigate the neural representations of orientation and motion direction in the human cortex and the role of visual attention in feature perception. The proposed studies will evaluate whether activity in early human visual areas corresponds with visual feature perception across changes in the surface properties of the stimulus. Specific Aim 1 will investigate the orientation-selective properties of early visual areas, and determine whether these areas show evidence of cue-invariant orientation selectivity that can effectively generalize across changes in stimulus form. Specific Aim 2 will assess direction selectivity in visual areas V1 through V4 and MT+, and test for cue-invariant direction selectivity and sensitivity to perceived global motion. Specific Aim 3 will explore the role of visual attention in selecting and stabilizing the representations of visual features. The results from this project will provide important new insights into the human neural bases of visual feature perception, and help provide a bridge between animal and human studies. The ability to measure the feature-selective properties of an individual's brain may also have high clinical significance. This approach may lead to effective new tools to investigate, characterize, or diagnose impairments in cortical visual function resulting from disease or injury, or methods to evaluate the cortical effects of medical treatment or recovery of function.\n",

      "ï»¿   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Prostate cancer is a heterogeneous disease with significant variations in its clinical outcome. Current methods to assess prostate cancer risk combine prostate specific antigen (PSA) screening and random prostate biopsy. Unfortunately, this strategy fails to reveal the lesion's location and does not accurately differentiate between aggressive and non-aggressive prostate cancers. As a result, most patients will receive unnecessary active treatment for low-risk prostate cancer in order to avoid under treatment. Active treatment involves surgery or radiation, often causing long-term side effects such as urinary incontinence, erectile dysfunction, or bowel urgency. Therefore, non-invasive and accurate diagnostic methods to determine the location of prostate cancer and to assess its immediate risk are needed.  The mission of Prostate Theranostics is to address this problem by developing targeting MRI contrast enhancing agents specific to an extracellular matrix (ECM) protein, oncofetal fibronectin (onfFN), for early accurate detection of prostate cancer. These agents would also be fitted with Gd(III)-chelates that would allow their location to be visualized within men's prostates using MRI. MRI is a non-invasive clinical diagnostic technique and can provide three-dimensional images of whole prostate with a resolution as high as 100 Âµm. Recent studies show that the over expression of extracellular matrix proteins within prostate tissue are correlated to prostate cancer aggressiveness. In addition, these proteins can be targeted using specific peptide sequences. This project proposes to develop MRI contrast-enhancing agents with specific peptide sequences. These targeting probes would then bind to aggressive prostate cancer after intravenous injection. In addition, the clinician would be able tovisualize location of human prostate cancer using MRI.  The objectives of this SBIR Phase I project are to further optimize the targeted contrast-enhancing agent and commercialize the agent for clinical imaging prostate cancer. Non-invasive accurate detection of prostate cancer is an unmet clinical need for prostate cancer management. Successful development of our imaging technology has the potential to accurately detect and diagnose prostate cancer, replace invasive prostate biopsy, and improve decision-making in clinical management of prostate cancer. It also has the potential for non-invasive active surveillance of prostate cancer and timely monitoring of disease progression, as well as image-guided surgery and therapy.\n",

      "Description (provided by applicant): The overall objective of the Animal Core is to provide centerinvestigators with the ability to utilize animal models in the execution of their proposed researchprojects, as well as, establish new animal models for the investigation of the mechanisms involved in the regulation of reproduction. The Center for Reproductive Research will utilize two animal models, mice and rats, in the execution of the research projects. Although the use of animal models provides an invaluable source of reagents for investigating regulatory mechanisms in vivo, in a physiologically regulated system, the use of animals in biomedical research is costly with respect to equipment, animal resources and technical expertise. The Animal Core will serve as a resource for the execution and training in the use of all animal manipulations needed in the Center. The Animal Core will minimize the cost of utilizing animal models in the Center Research Program by consolidating the equipment, expertise and animal resources. This will ensure an efficient use of animal research at minimal cost.\n",

      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, inflammatory neurodegenerative disease that affects the central nervous system and may lead to severe disability within 10-15 years. MS is diagnosed by clinical symptoms and presence of inflammation detected by magnetic resonance imaging. Other diseases present with similar symptoms, so diagnosis of MS is challenging. The lack of clear and objective biomarkers for diagnosis, monitoring, or prediction of outcomes complicates MS detection and treatment of MS patients. We propose to use a novel assay developed in our laboratory for analysis of DNA methylation to identify MS-specific changes of DNA methylation in multiple genes within each specimen, and to create a composite biomarker combining genes with the most diverse patterns of methylation. The blood-brain barrier is disrupted in MS patients, genomic DNA from dead cells is released into the bloodstream, so the assay can be based on cell-free circulating DNA. Specific Aims of the project are: (1) to establish a composite biomarker for detection of patients with relapsing-remitting MS in remission based on DNA methylation profile of cell-free circulating plasma DNA; (2) to establish a composite biomarker for detection of patients with relapsing-remitting MS during exacerbations based on DNA methylation profile of cell-free circulating plasma DNA, and to compare it with the biomarker established in Aim 1; (3) to compare DNA methylation profiles of patients with relapsing- remitting MS and secondary-progressive MS and to determine biomarkers specific for progression. The assay allows simultaneous detection of methylation in 56 gene promoters using DNA from 0.15 ml of plasma. The assay successfully detected MS-specific changes in DNA from plasma of MS patients. Completion of this project will produce a novel set of objective observer-independent biomarkers based on a fast, simple, and inexpensive procedure, and utilizing a simple, safe, and minimally invasive specimen collection. There are no reports on MS-specific DNA methylation, so this project will be the first to address this deficiency. The utility of cell-free circulating DNA for testing in MS has never been reported, so this project will be the first to use this opportunity. Consequently, other components of this project are without precedent: a biomarker for different forms of RR-MS, a biomarker for prediction of an attack, and a biomarker for disease progression to SP-MS will be developed for the first time. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the central nervous system, which can lead to severe disability and death. Diagnosis of MS is difficult because initial stages of the disease do not have obvious symptoms or even any symptoms at all, and there are no objective markers specific for MS. In this project we will use a new technique developed in our laboratory to evaluate DNA modifications (methylation) in blood of MS patients with active MS (attack or exacerbation) and stable MS (remission). Completed project will provide the first objective biomarker based on MS-specific DNA methylation, which can be used for diagnosis of MS, for evaluation of treatments success, and for prediction of outcomes.\n",

      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of The Clinical Profile of Parkinson's Disease (PD) Pathology, is to characterize the clinical profile of PD pathology in older person's without a diagnosis of PD. Showing that PD pathology is associated with a distinct and progressive condition among persons without a clinical diagnosis of PD, would have a transformative effect on PD studies. Although, PD only affects up to 5% of persons by age 85, compelling preliminary data shows that indices of PD pathology including nigral degeneration and Lewy bodies are present in nearly 20% of older persons without PD and are associated with the severity of parkinsonism proximate to death. This suggests that PD pathology is common and causes clinical signs in persons who do not meet clinical criteria for PD. Like the recent reclassification of AD, PD may also have an asymptomatic PD pathology phase, followed by a stage in which PD pathology results in mild motor and non-motor impairments not severe enough to warrant a diagnosis of PD, and a clinical diagnosis of PD is a later stage of the disease. Toward this end, we will apply a similar approach to that which has succeeded in transforming our ideas of AD. The proposed study will take advantage of two ongoing cohort studies, the Rush Religious Orders Study (P30AG10161) and the Memory and Aging Project (R01AG17917), whose participants have all agreed to annual clinical examination and organ donation at the time of death. Focusing on adults without clinical PD, we propose to delineate the extent and burden of PD pathology in both brain and spinal cord. Next, we propose to determine the associations of a wide range of motor and non- motor behaviors to PD pathology. Finally, we propose to develop a clinical profile for the detection of PD pathology with high sensitivity and specificity. This proposal offers the potential to greatly expand our knowledge of the clinical phase of PD and to identify people with PD for early intervention prior to overt clinial disease.\n",

      "hcv hepatitis infection chronic ifn antiviral infected interferon ribavirin virus\n",
      "--------------------\n",
      "HCV is a major public health problem, infecting more than 170 million people worldwide. Most cases of HCV infection become persistent and may eventually lead to chronic liver disease, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. HCV is an enveloped virus classified in the Flaviviridae family. The single-strand, positive-sense viral RNA genome encodes a single polyprotein precursor that is processed into three structural proteins (C, E1, E2) and seven nonstructural proteins (p7, NS2, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B) by host and viral proteases. The RNA genome of HCV has significant heterogeneity with six major genotypes and numerous subtypes. Until recently, chronic HCV infection has been  treated with pegylated alpha interferon and ribavirin. Although the treatment outcome is variable among the six major HCV genotypes, only 50% of treated patients infected with genotype 1 respond to therapy. Since the past two years, new treatments for HCV infection have emerged and hold great promise for cure, but numerous challenges to establishing care and receiving therapy exist. The ability of HCV to establish persistent infection with great success in humans has been attributed, in part, to a variety of strategies to evade host immune and IFN-induced defenses. Epidemiological studies suggest that up to 20% of acutely infected HCV patients can resolve the infection without treatment, which implies that innate and/or adaptive immune responses are indeed capable of controlling the outcome of HCV infection. The molecular mechanisms that regulate innate intracellular antiviral responses may therefore serve as pivotal points of control, potentially limiting host permissiveness for HCV replication and favorably modulating subsequent adaptive immune responses. Although hepatocytes are the major site of viral replication, a broad clinical spectrum of extrahepatic complications and diseases are associated with chronic HCV infection, including mixed cryoglobulinemia, non-Hodgkins lymphoma, cutaneous vasculitis, glomerulonephritis, neuropathy, and lymphoproliferative disorders. The existence of extrahepatic reservoirs of HCV replication, particularly in PBMCs, remains highly controversial. It is unclear how B cells become dysregulated during the course of chronic HCV infection. In our previous study, we demonstrated that in 7 out of 7 chronic HCV patients, HCV is preferentially associated with CD19+ B cells in PBMC subpopulations. Using in vitro reconstitution experiments by mixing cell-free HCV particles from chronic HCV carriers with PBMCs from healthy blood donors, we found that HCV particles preferentially bind to CD19+ B cells. HCV particles produced from in vitro cell cultures have minimal binding capacity to CD19+ B cells. However, when HCV particles produced in cell culture were pre-incubated with serum samples from HCV recovered patients and then mixed with PBMCs from healthy blood donors, the viral particles become preferentially bound to CD19+ B cells. Initially we thought the serum components which promote the binding of HCV to B cells were induced by HCV infection, such as HCV antigen-specific antibodies. Later, we demonstrated that the same activity can also be found in serum from healthy blood donors without any evidence of previous exposure to HCV.  Furthermore, we showed that the serum components which promote HCV binding to B cells are heat-labile.For our next phase of study, we will focus on the following projects: 1) To  investigate the mechanism of preferential binding of hepatitis C virus to B cells in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from chronic HCV carriers; 2) To identify specific cell surface receptors involved in HCV binding to B cells; 3) To determine whether the virus is merely attached to the cell surface or becomes intracellular and replicates; and 4) To elucidate the possible biological responses and consequences of HCV binding to B cells.\n",

      "--------------------\n",
      "ï»¿   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The impact of mitochondrial biology on human cancers is broad because these organelles are critical regulators of metabolism, proliferation, and apoptosis. Indeed, mitochondrial aberrations are common in multiple cancer types --- not only do mitochondrial dysfunctions correlate with disease pathogenesis, but aberrant mitochondria also negatively impact upon chemotherapeutic success. Within a cell, mitochondrial homeostasis is maintained by a process referred to as  mitochondrial dynamics , which is essential for mitochondrial genome integrity, efficient ATP generation, managing ROS, and the rapid distribution of mitochondrial metabolites. Mitochondrial dynamics result from the cumulative nature of two opposing forces: mitochondrial division and mitochondrial fusion. Recent published work from my group demonstrated: (1) mitochondrial division is chronically enhanced in RAS-transformed murine cells and human cancer lines harboring mutations within the MAPK pathway, (2) the mitochondrial division machinery is essential for cellular transformation, (3) targeted therapies that inhibit oncogenic MAPK signaling turn off the mitochondrial division machinery, and (4) chronic mitochondrial division is sufficient to initiate mitochondrial dysfunction and cancer cell metabolism. For decades, the presence of mtDNA mutations and mitochondrial dysfunction in cancer has been described, but the molecular mechanisms that drive these changes and their impact on cancer biology remain speculative. While others and we identified that mitochondrial division is requisite to cancer-associated mitochondrial dysfunction and is targeted by oncogenic MAPK pathway inhibitors, the molecular mechanisms linking mitochondrial division, mitochondrial dysfunction, and cancer cell survival are poorly understood. We hypothesize that oncogenic MAPK signaling induces chronic mitochondrial fragmentation, which supports mutation of the mitochondrial genome and subsequent functional heterogeneity within the mitochondrial network. This project emerged following years of effort to identify how mitochondrial division contributes to cancer biology, andwe propose three complementary specific aims. Aim 1: Establish that chronic mitochondrial division is responsible for cancer-associated mtDNA mutations and subsequent mitochondrial dysfunction in melanocytes. Aim 2: Demonstrate that chronic mitochondrial division induced mtDNA mutations link mitochondrial heterogeneity, tumorigenic potential, and metabolic plasticity. Aim 3: Reveal the broad requirement for chronic mitochondrial division in oncogenic transformation of cells and tissues. These aims will be achieved by using next-generation mtDNA sequencing, state-of-the-art mitochondrial function assays, and metabolomics approaches. Together, the results of this application will reveal that: (1) chronic mitochondrial division is permissive for mtDNA mutations, mitochondrial dysfunction, and tumorigenesis; and (2) proof-of- concept evidence that pharmacologically targeting chronic mitochondrial division may provide therapeutic potential to prevent and treat cancer.\n",

      "Biologists have been successful in revealing many of the molecular components involved in cell biology. Attention is now moving from identification of components to understanding the emergent, or system, behavior of the connected components. It has been hoped that general principles would emerge via the study of mathematical models of specific systems, but to date this form of study has not generally proven effective at discovering the hidden principles of biology. How the complex networks found in biological systems produce their emergent properties and behaviors remains elusive. Theoretical mathematics offers a possible route forward, and one which could, in time, have a profound influence on biology. This research project aims to cut through the complexity of biological models to elucidate the general principles of cell biology. Additionally, the project aims to develop new computational methods that can address currently infeasible problems. There is high demand for well-trained mathematical scientists with the interest and expertise necessary to contribute to the solution of questions arising in biology; this project will provide fertile training ground for graduate students.Discrete-space, continuous-time Markov chain models are commonly used to model biological interaction networks, including gene regulatory networks, viral infections, signaling systems, neuronal networks, etc. These models can be depicted via a reaction graph, which is a graphical representation of the interactions between the constituent molecules of the model. Interaction networks can be extraordinarily complex; for example, there are over 20,000 genes in the human genome and the proteins they encode may be modified in myriad ways. Further, cellular systems often have different sub-systems that operate on multiple different scales (both temporally and in terms of copy numbers), with the species operating at one scale greatly influencing those at a different scale. The reaction networks currently studied in the literature are typically so complex that numerical simulation is often considered the only way to analyze them. However, hidden within the complexity there are often underlying structures that, if properly quantified, give great insight into the dynamical or stationary behavior of the system. This project aims to develop mathematical theory that relates the emergent properties of these systems to easily-checked properties of the associated reaction graphs. A second aspect of the project is development and analysis of computational methods for stochastic models of biochemical interaction networks. The primary tools and methods utilized will be from probability theory, stochastic analysis, dynamical systems theory, chemical reaction network theory, and computational mathematics.This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\n",

      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): With an estimated annual incidence of 300,000-350,000 and accounting for 50% of all cardiovascular deaths in the US, sudden cardiac death (SCD) is a condition with significant implications for public health. Despite ongoing treatment advances in resuscitation science, survival among out-of-hospital cardiac arrest victims is <10%, making SCD prediction and prevention essential. While SCD risk is strongly associated with increasing age, manifestation in middle age (35-59 yr; approx. 30% of all SCD) is the most significant contributor to societal burden. However, published studies of SCD have focused almost exclusively on older patients (ï¿½60 yr), partly explained by insufficient numbers of middle-aged SCD cases among existing cardiovascular cohort studies. We have recently reported evidence for a distinctive profile of SCD in middle age compared to older age, indicating the significance of identifying middle age-specific SCD mechanisms. Middle aged SCD patients were more likely to present without prior warning, with obesity and non-white race playing a more important role. The overall hypothesis of this proposal is that a detailed and focused examination of novel factors associated with SCD in middle age will enhance the understanding of mechanisms and contribute to improved SCD risk prediction and prevention. Our specific aims are 1) To identify features of malignant coronary events that provoke lethal arrhythmias in middle age 2) To identify novel obesity-related risk factors contributing to SCD risk; and 3) To identify patient subgroups at highest risk of SCD in middle age.  Over twelve years ago, we initiated the Oregon Sudden Unexpected Death Study (Oregon SUDS) to identify novel risk predictors for SCD. This large study among one million residents of the Portland, Oregon metro area continues to accrue a significant number of SCD cases and controls. The critical need to identify risk predictors for SCD in middle age currently represents the largest knowledge gap in SCD. The established Oregon SUDS provides a unique discovery population with sufficient numbers of subjects, coupled with the opportunity to leverage existing detailed clinical and biomarker information. There is a high likelihood of identifying clinically and mechanistically relevant predictors of SCD risk that will enhance prediction and prevention of SCD.\n",

      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of the proposed epidemiologic study is to examine the causes and consequences of impaired decision-making in old age. Decision-making refers to the ability to generate and process multiple competing alternatives and choose a favorable behavior. Virtually all behaviors result from some decision-making process, and efficient decision-making is thought to be critical for maintaining independence, health and well-being in modern society. Emerging data suggest that older persons, even some without dementia, exhibit impaired decision-making, and impaired decision-making may be a sign of preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, surprisingly few studies have rigorously examined decision-making in older persons and longitudinal data are sorely lacking. The proposed study will quantify the rate of change in financial, healthcare, and socioemotional decision-making in a large cohort of community-based older persons without dementia and test the hypothesis that impaired decision-making is associated with adverse health outcomes (i.e., decreased well-being, disability, nursinghome placement, dementia, and death). Further, we will examine the role of affective and contextual factors in decision-making and test the hypothesis that select affective and contextual factors can sustain decision-making even in the face of cognitive decline. Finally, in an effort to understand the neurobiologic basis of impaired decision-making, we will test the hypothesis that AD pathology contributes to impaired decision-making in older persons without dementia who come to autopsy. The proposed study will capitalize on the unique infrastructure provided by the Rush Memory and Aging Project (R01AG17917), a large ongoing epidemiologic clinical-pathologic study of aging and AD, and will quantify decision-making and new pathologic indices in more than 800 community-based participants without dementia; all have agreed to detailed annual clinical evaluations including cognitive assessments and brain donation. By linking the newly collected data on decision-making and AD pathology in brain regions that subserve decision-making with the available data from the Memory and Aging Project, we will have an unprecedented opportunity to examine the causes and consequences of impaired decision-making in old age. Knowledge of the causes and consequences of impaired decision-making is essential for the development of effective interventions to promote independence, health, and well-being in old age.\n",

      "ï»¿   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Inflammatory bowel diseases are chronic and progressive inflammatory disorders that affect more than 1.4 million Americans. There is currently no cure for IBD, and over two-thirds of IBD patients become refractory to treatment with traditional therapies at some point in their lives and require surgical bowel resection. IBD i driven by inappropriate immune responses to the intestinal microbiota, which consists of trillions of bacteria that constitutively colonize the human intestine. The human gut microbiota shows considerable interindividual complexity and diversity with each person displaying a unique consortium of hundreds of bacterial species. Studies in mouse models of IBD have shown that select members of the microbiota have dramatic effects on colitis: some species exacerbate colitis by driving chronic inflammatory responses, while others protect against colitis by inducingimmunoregulatory responses. However, identifying the specific gut bacteria that influence IBD development, progression and severity in humans has remained challenging for two reasons: 1) an inability to distinguish bacterial species that influence disease susceptibility from the remaining members of the intestinal microbiota; and 2) difficulties in establishing experimental systems to directly test the effects of isolated human gut bacteria on disease. I recently conceived and developed a new approach to this problem that uses the host's own Immunoglobulin A response to the microbiota as a `tag' to identify putative immunomodulatory gut bacteria in humans. This strategy was used to identify members of the human gut microbiota from patients with IBD that could confer susceptibility to colitis when transferred intogerm-free mice; thus, this approach identifies colitogenic bacteria in IBD. However, the effects of these bacteria on T helper cells, which are the major drivers of pathology in human IBD, remain untested. Therefore, in the following studies, I will use the novel and innovative systems that I have recently established in order to determine the effects of specific putative immunomodulatory human gut microbes from humans on intestinal T cell differentiation and T cell-dependent colitis. In particular, I will: 1) determine the effects of putative inflammatory gu bacteria isolated from IBD patients on intestinal T cell differentiation and colitis; and 2) test te effects of putative immunoregulatory gut bacteria isolated from healthy humans on intestinal T cell differentiation and colitis. These studies will reveal the roles of specific members of the human gut microbiota in health and disease and identify new targets for the treatment and prevention of IBD.\n",

      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Development of allergic airway disease in mice depends on IL-4R1-mediated activation of Stat6 by IL-4 and IL- 13, with the latter cytokine being more important than the former during the effector phase of disease. We have evaluated the cell types through which IL-4 and IL-13 contribute to allergic airway disease and explored mechanisms responsible for the greater effects of IL-13. Results show that: 1) inhaled IL-4 and IL-13 can each independently induce airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) in mice through direct effects on airway smooth muscle cells; 2) AHR is induced independently of eosinophilia and goblet cell hyperplasia; 3) induction of AHR by IL-4 and IL-13 requires signaling through the type 2 IL-4R; 4) IL-4, but not IL-13, induces increased secretion of IFN-3 and IL-10, cytokines that can suppress allergic airway disease; 5) IL-4 signaling through the type 1 IL-4R suppresses the expression of some of the genes induced in the lungs by IL-13; and 6) IL-13 suppresses expression of miR-1, a microRNA expressed in muscle that suppresses translation of multiple genes that promote differentiation, proliferation and responsiveness. Concurrent studies by other investigators have shown that: 1) IL-13 can induce AHR through direct effects on pulmonary epithelium, but also induces AHR in mice whose pulmonary epithelium cannot directly respond to this cytokine; and 2) the type 2 IL-4R binds IL-13 differently and with greater affinity than it binds IL-4. Taken together, these observations suggest our 3 central hypotheses: 1) induction of AHR by IL-4 and IL-13 is completely accounted for by their effects on smooth muscle and airway epithelium; 2) IL-4/IL-13-induced changes in smooth muscle gene transcription and translation contribute to the effects of these cytokines on airway responsiveness and muscle remodeling and 3) the greater ability of inhaled IL-13 than IL-4 to increase AHR in mice results from IL-4 activation of the type 1 IL-4 receptor (IL-4R), with consequent production of IFN-3 and IL-10, rather than from differences in IL-4 vs. IL- 13 signaling through the type 2 IL-4R or IL-13R12. These hypotheses will be tested by 4 specific aims: 1. Determine whether IL-13 induction of AHR is prevented by deleting IL-4R1 from both smooth muscle and epithelial cells. 2. Compare development of chronic airway remodeling in mice that overexpress IL-4 or IL-13 in their lungs and selectively express IL-4R1 on smooth muscle or pulmonary epithelium. 3. Evaluate the effects of miR-1 downregulation on airway responsiveness and Identify genes that are up- or downregulated by IL-4 and IL-13 on airway smooth muscle cells. 4. Determine whether induction of IFN-3 and/or IL-10 by IL-4 contributes to the stronger induction of AHR by IL-13. Proposed experiments will use transgenic mice, recombinant cytokines, monoclonal antibodies, cell transfer systems, assays of in vivo cytokine production, flow cytometry and 3 different techniques for measuring airway responsiveness to test our hypothesis. Results should improve understanding of asthma pathogenesis, provide a model that can be used for in vivo tests of agents that may regulate smooth muscle-dependent AHR in human asthma and provide information that should guide the choice of IL-13 vs. IL-4R antagonists as potential asthma therapeutics.     PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Asthma, a chronic lung disease characterized by airway smooth muscle hyperplasia and hyperresponsiveness, affects more than 7% of Americans and has been increasing in incidence for the past 50 years. Two cytokines, IL-4 and IL-13, induce acute and chronic changes in pulmonary structure and function that contribute to airway hyperresponsiveness. However, mechanisms responsible for IL-4- and IL-13-induced changes in smooth muscle structure and function that contribute to airway hyperresponsiveness are poorly understood, as are mechanisms that account for differences in the effects of IL-4 vs. IL-13. Proposed studies with a mouse model in which airway hyperresponsiveness is induced solely by direct IL-4 and IL-13 effects on smooth muscle should help to elucidate these mechanisms and may reveal new approaches for asthma therapy.\n",

      "--------------------\n",
      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The transmitter dopamine (DA) is critical for motivation, reward, movement, and cognition. Originating in the ventral tegmental area (VTA), the mesolimbic DA pathway projects to the nucleus accumbens (NAc) core and shell where DA transmission contributes to the rewarding effects of food and drugs, and promotes goal- directed behavior and reward-related learning. Operating in parallel with the mesolimbic system, the nigrostriatal DA pathway originates in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) and projects to the caudate- putamen (CPu). This pathway contributes to motivated behavior and movement, and is involved in driving behaviors that have transitioned from goal-directed and intentional to automatic and compulsive. Given the key roles of these pathways, dysfunction of DA transmission plays a key role in neuropsychiatric disorders including addiction to psychostimulant drugs and the motor deficits of Parkinson's disease. Elucidating causal factors in these disorders, and developing corresponding treatments, requires an understanding of factors that govern DA release. It is often assumed that DA signaling is governed solely by DA neuron firing rate and pattern, with homogeneous activity-dependent changes in extracellular DA concentration ([DA]o) throughout the striatum. However, this is not the case: studies using fast-scan cyclic voltammetry (FCV) show that DA release is regulated locally within the striatum, with temporally and spatially discrete [DA]o transients detected in vivo and in ex vivo brain slices. Preliminary data suggest that a novel source of dynamic local DA release regulation is mediated by glutamate and GABA that are co-released from striatal DA axons. This project will determine autoregulatory roles of co-released glutamate and GABA on axonal DA release in NAc (Aim 1) and CPu (Aim 2), and somatodendritic DA release in VTA and SNc (Aim 3), in ex vivo slices from mice that express channelrhodopsin 2 (ChR2) in DA neurons. Companion studies will assess the presence of glutamate and GABA receptor subunits on striatal DA axons using immuno-electron microscopy. Based on preliminary data showing enhanced AMPA receptor-dependent regulation of striatal DA release in ex vivo slices 24 h after a single cocaine injection, each aim will include examination of the effect of acute cocaine exposure on DA release regulation by co-released transmitters. Overall, this project will define the roles of co-released glutamate and GABA in sculpting how changes in DA neuron activity translate into DA release, and how this regulation can be disrupted by cocaine.\n",

      "Our work focuses on two major research themes. One theme attempts to elucidate normative psychological and neurobiological mechanisms of fear and anxiety in healthy individuals in order to identify which of these mechanisms are perturbed in anxiety disorders. Anxiety is an adaptive response to threat that enables organisms to efficiently confront challenges either via rapid flight or fight responses (fear) or via sustained increased vigilance and behavioral inhibition (anxiety). When anxiety is evoked by anticipation of an unpleasant stimulus such as a mild electric shock (induced-anxiety), our sensorimotor system becomes primed to detect and react quickly to any threat. Our past work shows that this effect is mediated by increased communication between an aversive amplification circuit that includes the dorsal-medial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) and the amygdala.  Phasic increased dmPFC-amygdala communication is responsible for our ability to rapidly detect and react to threat, but when switched on chronically it is also responsible for the crippling attentional bias for threat that characterizes anxious individuals.  Additionally, we have identified a potential vulnerability marker for panic attack. Our past studies showed that patients with panic disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder have a propensity to show elevated sustained anxiety to unpredictable threat. Initial results from a collaborative family study of mood and anxiety disorders with Dr. Merikangas suggested that such increased anxiety response to unpredictable threat was also found in individuals with a history of panic attack, regardless of their disorders. Ongoing studies in our lab confirm this link between panic attack and heightened response to unpredictable threat. Current results show that among patients with social phobia or/and generalized anxiety disorder, a history of panic attack is associated with increased response to unpredictable threat. Because we also found that such anxiety response is heritable, our results suggest that an exaggerated response to unpredictable threat constitutes a risk factor for panic attack and, by extension, anxiety disorders given that individuals with a history of panic attack are at increased risk for these conditions.Because of our interest in responses to unpredictable threat, we have initiated a series of neuroimaging studies focusing on the BNST, a structure implicated in sustained anxiety in animal models, but which has been much less investigated than the amygdala, a structure critically involved in fear.  One study examined BNST resting-state functional connectivity using ultra-high field 7 Tesla MRI scan. We identified strong BNST functional connectivity in the amygdala, hippocampus, thalamic subregions, caudate, periaqueductal gray, hypothalamus, and cortical areas such as the medial PFC and precuneus. While connectivity with many of these regions has previously been described in rodents and nonhuman primate studies, connectivity with other regions such as the dorsolateral PFC, precuneus, caudate, medial PFC, and nucleus accumbens has not been reported previously. We are currently analyzing changes in BNST functional connectivity during the anticipation of unpredictable shock. Improving our understanding of the anatomy of anxiety should facilitate identification of pathophysiological mechanisms and provide targets for better treatments.According to data from animal models, corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) receptors are involved in fear and anxiety. However, the specific nature of this role remains to be determined and the degree to which CRF effects in animals apply to humans is poorly understood. CRF receptors differentially affect fear and anxiety responses in animals. In rodents, sustained anxiety is maintained by activation of CRF1 receptors in the BNST. Because the BNST has inhibitory connections with the medial portion of the central nucleus of the amygdala, which mediates fear, activation of BNST receptors can inhibit fear. Indeed, in rodents CRF1 receptor antagonists reduce anxiety, but have no effect or even can enhance fear. We recently tested the effect of the CRF antagonist GSK561679 developed by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) on fear to predictable shock and anxiety to unpredictable shock in healthy individuals.  Results showed that while anxiety was reduced by a classic anxiolytic, the benzodiazepine alprazolam, it was not affected by GSK561679.  Conversely, fear was not affected by alprazolam but it was enhanced by GSK561679. Taken together studies in animals and our study confirm that CRH has inhibitory and excitatory roles on aversive responses.A second theme focuses on the interactions between anxiety and cognition. Anxiety influences cognition, positively or negatively, and conversely, cognitive processes can foster or reduce anxiety. Clarifying the mechanisms underlying anxiety x cognitive interactions is critical to understand the factors that lead to and/or maintain anxiety, particularly maladaptive anxiety, and to formulate treatment approaches. Recently, we examined behavioral inhibition.  Humans and animals show avoidance and freezing responses when threatened. These behaviors are adaptive; they minimize the likelihood of capture or detection by a predator.  However, we recently showed that patients with anxiety disorders exhibit a chronic enhancement of behavioral inhibition, even in the absence of threat, leading to maladaptive cautious behaviors.  Using a task that tests vigilance and behavioral inhibition, the sustained attention to response task (SART), we have started to map neural mechanisms by which anxiety affects behavioral inhibition.  In healthy individuals, anxiety, induced by shock threat, facilitates behavioral inhibition. This facilitation is mediated by activating a right lateralized frontoparietal group of regions. Because these regions are also involved in sustained attention, our next study will explore whether activation of these regions reflects improved behavioral inhibition per se or enhanced sustained attention. In a related study, we investigated mechanisms by which anxiety interferes with day-to-day activity.  Indeed, anxiety patients report difficulty concentrating, together with feeling distracted, which in turn can negatively impact their job performance and interpersonal relationships. We have examined individuals' ability to focus attention when anxious during performance of working memory (WM) tasks. WM is central to healthy functioning because it supports maintenance and manipulation of information (e.g., keeping in mind a phone number).  One key question is whether underlying deficits in patients with anxiety disorders is the same as that due to elevated anxiety state.  We examined neural activity during WM performance in patients with anxiety disorders and in controls during anticipation shocks. We focused on two brain regions, the dorsolateral prefrontal (dlPFC), which is activated by cognitively demanding tasks, and regions of the default mode network (DMN), such as the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), which are typically activated during self-referential processes but deactivated during demanding tasks.  We showed that clinical anxiety was associated with under-engagement of the dlPFC, suggesting poor cognitive control. This effect was independent of state anxiety.  Conversely, clinical anxiety and state anxiety were associated with reduced DMN activation, probably reflecting difficulty to disengage from self-referential thoughts. By describing the neural underpinnings of anxiety/cognition interactions we are one step closer to identifying biomarkers of vulnerability to anxious pathology, and discrete neural sites for novel treatments that target both emotional and cognitive disruptions associated with anxiety.\n",

      "stroke motor recovery rehabilitation ischemic disability cerebral survivors gait acute\n",
      "--------------------\n",
      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A large portion of the estimated $2.2 trillion stroke-related costs estimated in the U.S. between 2005 and 2050 pertains to the cost of care during the recovery period after the brain trauma, which in turn is highly correlated with the level of disability. These figures point to the urgency of improving post stroke neurorehabilitation, particularly since there are no drugs available, nor are there any in the pipeline, to facilitate functional recovery after stroke. Until recently, only few studies focused on the basic mechanisms and potential improvement of post stroke functional recovery. Previous findings from our laboratory, and some promising human data about non-invasive brain stimulation in recovering stroke patients, point to an imbalance between excitatory/inhibitory cortical circuits as a major obstacle in post stroke functional recovery. We will use a mouse model of stroke to examine how the outcome of brain stimulation after the injury can be improved. Photothrombotic stroke will be induced in the motor cortices of mice using a novel stroke model developed for focal ischemia induction in awake freely moving animals. We will test the hypothesis that the modulation of a highly specific component of the affected cortical microcircuits will provide the best outcome on functional recovery after stroke. Four different transgenic mouse lines will be used for specific optogenetic manipulations of excitatory and inhibitory cortical microcircuits in the peri-infarct region, or in the equivalent cortical area on the contralateral hemisphere. 1) Cortical pyramidal cells will be stimulated in the peri-infarct zone to test the effects of ipsilesonal stimulation of excitatory circuits; 2) The activity of inhibitory GABAergic cells will be suppresse in the peri-infarct zone to reduce the enhanced inhibition observed after stroke, previously shown by our lab to obstruct the path to functional recovery; 3) Peri-infarct glial cells will be stimulated to test whether impaired glial activity and a secondarily reduced GABA uptake may contribute to the observed enhancement in inhibition and the ensuing delayed functional recovery; 4) Contralateral to the infarct, GABAergic cells will be stimulated to dampen the output of the healthy motor cortex which may act to lower the activity of the lesioned side. Optical stimulation will be carried out for 5 days after stroke induction in daily 1-hour sessions, based o protocols of non-invasive, but non-specific brain simulation in human subjects. In addition to more traditional measures of functional motor recovery in mice, we will use a novel automated measurement of the mouse's movements on an air-supported sphere, which can be subjected to better quantification than previously used measures of motor recovery. By introducing novel approaches in stroke induction, stimulation therapy, and outcome metrics, the project addresses scientific questions related to the enormous economical and health burdens of stroke in both the U.S. and worldwide. The project will also identify specific target systems for promoting rehabilitation in the clinical practice, to result in a healthier life and an earlier functional reovery of stroke victims.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Stroke is the major cause of chronic disability worldwide and it is estimated to cost the U.S. $2.2 trillion between 2005 to 2050. A large portion of this amountpertains to the cost of care during the recovery period, which in turn is highly correlated with th level of disability. These figures point to the urgency of improving post-stroke neurorehabilitation, particularly since there are no drugs available, nor are there any in the pipeline to facilitate functional recovery after stroke. Experimental approaches in humans geared to facilitate post-stroke recovery include non-invasive and highly non-specific brain simulation. We will use a mouse model of stroke to examine how we can improve on the outcome of brain stimulation after stroke. Optical stimulation (or dampening) of the activities of specific elements of injured cortical microcircuits will be tested to find out the most effective intervention for stroke recovery. By introducing novel approaches in stroke research, the project will addresses scientific questions related to the enormous health and economical burdens of stroke in both the US and worldwide. The project will identify specific target systems that can be translated in the future into clinical practice, to accomplish a better and speedier recovery of function in stroke victims.\n",

      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is based on the hypothesis that at least partially distinct neural and cognitive mechanisms are involved in the etiology of and recovery from Attention-deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder - combined type (ADHD-C). We posit that ADHD-C is due to a primary deficit in a neural system emerging from the reticular formation within the hindbrain/midbrain region that is present early in ontogeny and remains relatively static throughout the lifetime. Further, we posit that the diminution of symptoms frequently seen throughout development is related to the degree to which frontostriatal systems are able to compensate for these early deficits through the use of effort or  top-down  executive control. To test this hypothesis, we propose to use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) along with neurocognitive measures in three groups of young adults. Two groups consist of patients from a longitudinal sample, all of whom met criteria for ADHD-C during childhood. Among these, many can be clearly identified either as ADHD persisters (ADHD-P) or ADHD remitters (ADHD-R). In addition, we have well-matched controls who never met criteria for any subtype of ADHD. Thus, we will evaluate the neural correlates of diverse developmental pathways in ADHD-C. If our hypotheses are correct, behavioral and fMRI indices of the system emerging the reticular formation should differ from controls in those who had childhood ADHD-C irrespective of adult clinical status. In contrast, measures of frontostriatal function should vary as a function of adult status such that more severe ADHD symptoms in adulthood are associated with poorer efficiency on these measures while those no longer having significant ADHD symptoms should perform more similarly to never-ADHD controls.\n",

      "Hepatitis C virus is both difficult to treat and a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. It is not understood how hepatitis C establishes infection nor how some patients clear infection. To this end 83 humans exposed to hepatitis C were studied in protocol 00-DK-0221. The immune response (both antibody and T cell) was closely followed and is being characterized. The study is in collaboration with Dr. Rehermann. As an extension of this 28 patients with acute hepatitis C have been followed and treated as indicated. Twenty-five patients (16 women; mean age 43 years) had adequate follow up to be included in an analysis.  Symptoms in the acute phase were reported by 80% and jaundice by 40%. Two patients (8%) developed ascites and acute liver failure but both survived.  Genotype 1 was most frequent (72%) but many patients (20%) could not be genotyped.   Serum aminotransferase levels and HCV RNA levels fluctuated greatly; 18% of patients were intermittently negative for HCV RNA.   In follow up, 5 patients recovered spontaneously whereas 20 developed chronic hepatitis C or received interferon-based therapy during the acute phase.  Among 15 patients treated during the acute phase with peginterferon with or without ribavirin for 24 weeks, all became HCV RNA negative within 4 to 8 weeks, and all except two achieved a sustained virological response with the exceptions being HIV-positive.  Side effects (particularly psychiatric) were common and limited the duration of therapy in 30% of patients.  To further understand the virological determinants of infection and the development of chronicity, the hepatitis C virus sequence in the early stages of infection has been determined from the same patients. In particular the sequencing effort is focused on the viral sequence before and after treatment, in the two patients who were HIV positive and relapsed. The complete sequence has been determined and is now being analyzed. A second laboraratory project has been to study the nature of late relapse after treatment for hepatitis C. The first 103 patients who achieved a sustained virologic response at the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center were reviewed. Three patients had a late relapse. The viral sequence from these patients was studied from before treatment, from the liver at the time of sustained virologic response, and from the serum at the time of documented relapse. The viral sequences obtained from before treatment, the liver at the time of sustained virologic response, and from the serum at the time of relapse were all virtually identical proving relapse and not reinfection. A third laboratory project currently underway is to use viral sequencing to understand discrepancies in commercial genotyping assays.A collaborative project with Drs. Natanya Sandler and Danny Doueck was to determine the relationship between markers of microbial translocation and chronic liver disease. We investigated whether the extent and progression of liver disease in patients with chronic HBV or HCV infection are associated with microbial translocation and subsequent activation of monocytes. In a retrospective study, we analyzed data from 16 patients with minimal fibrosis, 68 with cirrhosis, and 67 uninfected volunteers. We analyzed plasma levels of soluble CD14 (sCD14), intestinal fatty acid binding protein, and interleukin-6 by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) by the limulus amebocyte lysate assay, at presentation and after antiviral treatment. Compared with uninfected individuals, HCV- and HBV-infected individuals had higher plasma levels of LPS, intestinal fatty acid binding protein (indicating enterocyte death), sCD14 (produced upon LPS activation of monocytes), and interleukin-6. Portal hypertension, indicated by low platelet counts, was associated with enterocyte death (P = .045 at presentation, P < .0001 after therapy). Levels of sCD14 correlated with markers of hepatic inflammation (P = .02 for aspartate aminotransferase, P = .002 for ferritin) and fibrosis (P < .0001 for &#947;-glutamyl transpeptidase, P = .01 for alkaline phosphatase, P < .0001 for &#945;-fetoprotein). Compared to subjects with minimal fibrosis, subjects with severe fibrosis at presentation had higher plasma levels of sCD14 (P = .01) and more hepatic CD14(+) cells (P = .0002); each increased risk for disease progression (P = .0009 and P = .005, respectively). LPS-induced local and systemic inflammation is associated with cirrhosis and predicts progression to end-stage liver disease in patients with HBV or HCV infection.A second type of chronic hepatitis studied is hepatitis D. Hepatitis D is the most aggressive form of viral hepatitis as well as the most difficult to treat. Interferon therapy is the standard approach. Patients are typically treated for 6 months to a year. Relapse after cessation of therapy is the norm. In protocol 01-DK-0247 patients are treated with peginterferon for 5 years. The dose is titrated to maintain normal ALT and minimize side effects. Patients are evaluated before initiating therapy, and after 1, 3, and 5 years. Patients are excluded if they do not meet protocol-defined criteria for response at the 1 year evaluation. Enrollment was planned for 10 - 20 patients. Thirteen patients have been enrolled, and of the 12 who have had one-year evaluations 10 have met the protocol definition of response. Most of the patients were male (11) and tended to have advanced disease (median baseline Ishak fibrosis - 4). Patients were treated for a mean duration of 144 weeks (range 6 - 300) at an average weekly peginterferon dose of 184 &#956;g. At one year of treatment, inflammatory scores were significantly improved (10.6  2.7 vs. 7  1.9, p<0.01) and this improvement persisted in 4 of 5 patients who had a 3 year biopsy scored. There was no difference in the fibrosis score. ALT decreased significantly after one year (136  143 vs. 46  13, p<0.05) and persistant biochemical response on treatment was achieved by 3 patients (27%). 3/13 patients (27%) lost HBsAg after 24, 37 and 202 weeks of treatment and developed HBs antibodies. Treatment was stopped in these patients at least 24 weeks later; the serological response was durable and was associated with persistent improvement of ALT and platelet count during follow-up. Two patients (15%) died during therapy, one from hepatocellular carcinoma and the other from herpes colitis. Both deaths were not considered related to treatment. There were no other serious adverse events and treatment was well-tolerated overall. 3 patients required a dose reduction due to cytopenias. The primary end point of the study is the evaluation after three years although it is planned to treat patients for 5 years. Hepatitis D viral RNA and hepatitis B surface antigen levels have been measured, the final analysis is currently being completed.\n",

      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This application addresses broad Challenge Area (03) Biomarker Discovery and Validation and specific Challenge Topic, 03-AR-103 Biomarkers: Bench to Bedside for Autoimmune and Inflammatory Skin and Rheumatic Diseases. Title: Proteomic Identification of Actionable Biomarkers in Rheumatoid Arthritis Project Summary/Abstract Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is the most common inflammatory joint disease of autoimmune etiology and remains a cause of substantial morbidity and mortality. Effective treatment of RA has been impeded by a paucity of diagnostic/predictive biomarkers of RA, largely as a result of the heterogeneity of the disease and a lack of insight into the mechanisms that underlie the onset and progression of RA. Nevertheless, the advent of biological therapeutics has led to significant advances in the treatment of RA. Promising findings from several placebo-controlled trials support the concept of treating patients in the early stages of RA (early RA) with combination therapies (e.g., methotrexate in concert with an anti-TNF agent) in order to slow and prevent joint damage. Furthermore, recent data suggest that it might be possible to induce disease remission in patients with early RA, such that anti-TNF therapy could then be withdrawn. At present, however, RA is diagnosed once arthritis is already established, a time at which the window of opportunity for effective treatment may have been missed. A test for the early diagnosis of RA is therefore warranted, as early diagnosis would enable the identification of patients with asymptomatic and/or early arthritis for their enrollment in primary RA prevention trials, and could ultimately be used by primary care physicians and rheumatologists to identify pre-disease RA patients that would benefit from early therapeutic intervention. A corollary of this is the need to determine what specific therapy an RA patient should receive, given that approximately one-third of RA patients exhibit robust responses to anti-TNF therapeutics - currently a mainstay of RA therapy - while one-third do not exhibit clinical improvement. Thus, a test that enables prediction of whether or not an RA patient will respond to anti- TNF and other disease-modifying therapies would be of great value to rheumatologists and patients alike. For this Challenge Grant application we propose the development of tests for (i) the early diagnosis of RA, (ii) predicting the severity of RA, and (iii) guiding the selection of RA patients that should receive anti-TNF or small molecule therapies. Robust biomarkers are directly related to the mechanisms underlying disease, and this proposal will provide insights into the mechanisms that underpin the development of autoimmunity in RA, the progression of RA, and the response to anti-TNF therapy. Our laboratory developed RA antigen microarrays to profile the specificity of autoantibody responses in RA. RA antigen microarray analysis revealed the targeting of a variety of candidate native and citrullinated antigens by autoantibodies in established RA. In addition, through the use of optimized BioPlex bead-array methods for the analysis of cytokines in RA sera, we demonstrated that blood cytokine levels are elevated in one-third of patients with early RA, and that elevated blood cytokines are associated with autoantibody targeting of citrullinated proteins. Furthermore, we identified autoantibody and cytokine signatures that differentiate between distinct subsets of RA patients, thus providing insight into the heterogeneity of RA. In Aim 1, we will expand and apply RA antigen arrays and bead array cytokine assays to characterize serial pre-arthritis samples to determine the specificity and titers of autoantibodies, as well as the levels of serum cytokines, and to define their temporal relationships to the onset of clinical RA. Our overriding hypothesis is that asymptomatic individuals that ultimately develop clinical RA exhibit a series of pre-arthritis phenotypes characterized initially by the production of autoantibodies, subsequently by an increase in cytokine and chemokine levels, and finally by epitope spreading of the autoantibody response, which results in progression to clinical arthritis. Elucidation of the hierarchy of epitope spreading and cytokine elevations will provide insights into the events that trigger progression to clinical RA. Such findings could lead to development of an early RA diagnostic that could provide the basis for preventive interventions in RA. The proposed studies will also identify biomarkers associated with progression to severe RA, and these biomarkers will provide insights into the mechanisms underlying progression of disease. We will further apply these proteomic technologies to identify biomarkers that are (i) predictive of and (ii) pharmacodynamic markers for response to anti-TNF and small molecule therapies. In Aim 2, we will extend our efforts to convert these biomarkers onto the clinical-grade BioPlex assay format, and we will use BioPlex technology for the high-throughput characterization of all samples in the pre-disease, disease progression, and response to therapy cohorts. The success of this proposal would result in the development of novel clinical diagnostic tests that would transform the care for patients with RA. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune arthritis that affects 0.6% of the world population. This proposal will identify novel autoantibody and cytokine biomarkers for (i) early diagnosis, (ii) predicting disease severity, and (iii) guiding therapeutic decision making for the treatment of RA.\n"
