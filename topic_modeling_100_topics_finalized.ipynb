    "NMF is a model used for topic extraction - while the LDA model uses raw counts of unique words per document, NMF model uses a normalized representation of those raw counts (TF-IDF representation)\n",
    "\n",
    "TF stands for term-frequency and TF-IDF is term-frequency times inverse document-frequency. In other words, we are not only looking for how often a word appears in a given document, but also whether this particular word is distinct across all the collections of documents (corpus). For example, intuitively we understand that words like \"often\" or \"use\" are more frequently encountered, but they are less informative (more semantically-vacuous) if we want to discern a particular topic of a document, as they might be frequently encounter across all text documents in a corpus. On the other hand, words which we will see less frequently across a collection of document might indicate that those words are specific to a particular document, and, therefore, constitute a basis for a topic. \n",

      "The study of human immunology is often difficult because certain types of experiments can't be performed on humans for obvious ethical reasons. To facilitate human research, many scientists utilize animal models. The animal model of choice for immunologists is the mouse. This animal model is very useful because of the large number of reagents available as well as the creation of transgenic and knockout mice. Both types of mice are required for this program project grant. Transgenic carrying  humanized  MHC molecules will be iused to discover new epitopes for influenza proteins in project 2 and in project 3, they will be used to model human influenza infection in mice. Knockout mice are required so that the mouse endogenous MHC class Ior II genes are not expressed in the MHC transgenic mice. Two projects will require some of thesame strains of mice and procedures, so for continuity between the projects an animal core providing the necessary services is required. The specific aims of the animal core are: 1) to provide high quality housing, husbandry, and health care for the mice that are used in the studies proposed by Center investigators, 2) to provide a dedicated, stable space for the mice used in the proposed studies, and 3) to provide expertise in the delivery of viral vectors to mice to ensure proper biocontainment of the vectors and efficient immunization of experimental animals.\n",

The acceptability and feasibility of the intervention will be assessed in a two-arm pilot randomized trial (n=60) that will compare the effects of a lifestyle intervention (n=30) to a minimal control intervention (n=30). The R34 evaluation at the end of 6 months and at 12 months will examine changes in weight and biomarkers including fasting blood glucose and insulin, HbA1c, lipid profile (total, HDL and LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides), and blood pressure. Measures of lifestyle changes will include dietary intake and physical activity. The study will also assess change in psychological measures. The pilot study will use the RE-AIM evaluation framework to focus on: Reach - How many of the eligible participants actually enrolled in the study? Efficacy/Effectiveness -How did the intervention affect participant's weight and other measures? Adoption: How acceptable were the interventions to the participants? Implementation - How many of the intervention activities were provided as planned? Maintenance - How much of the intervention effect is sustainable? The longer term effects of the intervention will be evaluated in a subsequent R18 clinical trial. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Lifestyle change can reduce the risk of developing diabetes. This project will tailor the successful Diabetes Prevention Program lifestyle intervention to focus on the needs of high risk immigrants from China. The effects of the intervention will be evaluated in a pilot study assessing lifestyle and weight changes. The evaluation of the intervention will be used to plan a larger study to examine health outcomes.\n",

      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV dementia (HIV-D) and HIV-associated sensory neuropathy (HIV-SN) are the most common neurological manifestations of advanced HIV infection. The prevalence of HIV-D and HIV-SN in Sub- Saharan Africa where the majority of HIV cases reside globally is largely unknown. In addition, HIV subtype may have an impact on HIV disease progression, suggesting the possibility that HIV subtypes may differ with respect to their ability to cause neurological disease. The project will assemble a cohort of HIV+ individuals in Uganda: 1) to determine the prevalence of and risk factors associated with HIV-D and HIV-SN among untreated HIV+ individuals with moderate advanced immunosuppression, 2) to determine whether untreated HIV+ individuals decline from baseline in neuropsychological test performance, and peripheral nerve function, and 3) to obtain preliminary data to determine whether HIV subtypes differ with respect to the risk of HIV-D and HIV-SN, and progression of HIV-associated cognitive impairment and peripheral nerve function. We propose one of the first large scale prospective studies of HIV-D and HIV-SN in Sub-Saharan Africa. This proposal will provide the data necessary to characterize the prevalence and progression of HIV-D and HIV-SN, which could be used for future R01 applications. HIV-associated cognitive impairment is currently not an indication for HAART initiation in HIV+ individuals with a CD4 count in the 201-350 cells/ÃÂ¿L range. Our proposal will provide the data necessary to determine if clinical practice parameters for the initiation of HAART among HIV+ individuals with moderate immunosuppression and mild neurocognitive impairment should be changed in countries within Sub-Saharan Africa such as Uganda. Our proposal will examine whether HIV subtypes may differ with respect to their ability to cause HIVassociated CNS and PNS dysfunction. The proposal will also provide training for the HIV clinician-scientists in Kampala, Uganda in research studies of HIV-associated neurological disease. Based upon our preliminary data, we believe that HIV-D and HIV-SN are frequently unrecognized complications of advanced HIV infection in Sub-Saharan Africa, and are a significant cause of morbidity in HIV+ individuals in Uganda, which if identified early, can be treated effectively with antiretroviral therapy and symptomatic therapies.     PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The epidemiology of HIV dementia (HIV-D) and HIV-associated sensory neuropathy (HIV-SN) in Sub-Saharan Africa where the majority of HIV cases reside globally is largely unknown.

      "In scattering theory, due to the complexity of material properties and uncertainty in physical models and parameters, precise modeling and accurate computing present challenging and significant mathematical and computational questions. The PI proposes to develop mathematical models, examine mathematical issues, and design computational methods for new and important classes of direct and inverse problems that arise from the acoustic and electromagnetic wave propagation in complex and random environments. The mathematical modeling techniques and computational methods developed in this project address several key scientific challenges in applied and computational mathematics, which include: (1) multi-scale modeling and computation of the wave propagation in a heterogeneous medium; (2) computational stochastic direct and inverse scattering problems; (3) numerical solution of Maxwell's equations and well-posedness of associated models; (4) global uniqueness, local stability, and numerical solution of the ill-posed inverse scattering problems. The educational plan is to foster greater awareness of the broad and important applications of mathematics so as to attract more students in pursuing a major, a minor, or a graduate degree in mathematics. The proposed education activities include: (1) undergraduate and graduate courses and curriculum development; (2) mentoring of undergraduate, graduate, and postdoc research; (3) organizing summer schools, seminars, and workshops. The dramatic growth of computational capability and the development of fast algorithms have transformed the methodology for scientific investigation and industrial applications in the field of scattering theory. Reciprocally, the practical applications and scientific developments have driven the need for more sophisticated mathematical models and numerical algorithms to describe the scattering of complicated structures, and to accurately compute acoustic and electromagnetic fields and thus to predict the performance of a given structure, as well as to carry out optimal design of new structures. The proposed computational models and tools are highly promising for qualitative and quantitative study of the complex physical and mathematical problems in optics and electromagnetics, and provide an inexpensive and easily controllable virtual prototype of the structures in the design and fabrication of optical and  electromagnetic devices. The research is multidisciplinary by nature and lies at the interface of mathematics, physics, engineering, and materials sciences. In addition, it has significant potential to advance the frontiers of applied and computational mathematics, and even to have impact on other branches of science.\n",

      "Ã¯Â»Â¿   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This R21 proposal is in direct response to PA-13-145, entitled  Development of Animal Models and Related Biological Materials for Research . The goal of this proposal is to develop two new animal models to fill major unmet needs in a broad array of fields, including immunology, virology, and stem cell medicine. The surface of all nucleated cells are covered in MHC class I molecules that present peptides derived from proteins made in the cell. T cells scan the surface of a cell, and engage only cells in which theirT cell receptor has affinity for a specific MHC-peptide complex. Once the T cell engages, the outcome is highly dependent on the cell presenting the antigen and the local context. Different cell types can result in different T cell responses; for example some cells may direct CD4+ T cell to differentiate into an effector, whereas presentation by other cells may direct them to become regulatory. How a T cell interacts with a particular cell type is one of the most important questions in immunology. The answer can tell us why some cell types are more prone to autoimmune responses, and why other cell types, such as cancer cells, may be less prone to T cell killing. While we know how T cells react with some cell types, there are many cell types whose interaction with T cells has never been studied. For example, we do not know how T cells interact with many types of stem cells. We hypothesize that if green florescent protein (GFP) can be utilized as a model antigen, than T cell interactions with numerous cell types, which were not previously studied including many types of stem cells, can be investigated. The objective of Aim 1 is to generate mice in which the T cells recognize an epitope of GFP presented in MHC class I or II. The outcome of Aim 1 would establish an antigen-specific T cell model that targets a commonly used, easily monitored, florescent reporter. Since GFP-specific CD8+ T cells can kill GFP-expressing cells, we hypothesize that GFP-specific CD8+ T cells can be used to selectively deplete almost any cell population in a mouse, if the cell type of interest s expressing GFP. We have already obtained preliminary data showing that we can use GFP-specific T cells to kill GFP expressing cells in the spleen, pancreas, gut, and heart. The objective of Aim 2 is to compare T cell mediated cell ablation to diphtheria toxin (DT)-mediated depletion, and to determine how effectively we can use the GFP-specific T cells to kill cells in the brain. The outcome of these studies will establish a new method of cell depletion that can be used with the 100s of cell type-specific GFP expressing mice that already exist, and it is potentially less inflammatory than DT-mediated depletion. The abundance of GFP-based reagents and animal models makes the GFP-specific T cell mice relevant for numerous labs doing a wide variety of research including, but not limited to: (i) understanding the antigen presenting capacity of specific cell types, (ii) modeling autoimmune destruction, (iii) characterization of pathogen-T cell interactions, and for (iv) identifying the function of specificcells in vivo.\n",

      "Thie Quantitative and Functional Proteomics Core ofthe University of Washington Diabetes Research Center provides affiliate investigators the powerful tools of modern mass spectrometry and complex data set analysis. The goals of the Core are to: (1) Perform mass spectrometric (MS) analyses such as quantifying target analytes and obtaining spectra for structural identification of proteins.

      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A main focus of systems neuroscience is to understand how sensory information is encoded and used to guide behavior. Perceptual decision-making, like nearly all normal behavioral processes and disorders of the nervous system, is thought to involve the activity of large groups of neurons. Technical limitations, however, have forced most physiological studies to focus on single neurons. These studies have provided many important insights, but they necessarily miss key information about the relationship between groups of sensory neurons and decisions. For example, single neuron responses cannot tell us how that neuron's activity interacts and is combined with that of other neurons within or between cortical areas. Furthermore, my prior work showed that the cognitive state of even a well-trained subject fluctuates greatly from moment to moment, with striking consequences on performance on perceptual tasks. Therefore, combining information from single neurons recorded at different times produces an average over many behavioral states.  The experiments in this proposal use the activity of many simultaneously recorded neurons while animals perform a visual discrimination task to track each perceptual decision while it is inprogress. Our goal is to understand how the responses of neurons with different physiological, visual and cognitive properties who come from different cortical areas and interact with nearby neurons in different ways are combined to drive decisions. In Specific Aim 1, we will ask how the responses of neurons with different functional properties are combined to guide decisions by assessing the relationship between the animal's choices and the activity of neurons that differ in their ability to encode the relevant information or are modulated differently by cognitive factors such as visual attention. In Aim 2, we will assess the validity of current models of decision-making by determining the effect of shared (or correlated) response variability on perceptual performance. The responses from a few dozen simultaneously recorded neurons will provide a means of assessing the correlation structure of a large population and isolating the effects of correlated variability from accompanying changes in firing rates. In Aim 3, we will examine the role of neurons in different visual areas in decisions, ask whether there is complementary choice-related activity in different areas, and determine whether the role of each area is flexible We will record simultaneously from groups of neurons in V4, a ventral stream area, and MT, a dorsal stream area, to determine whether we can better predict the animal's decisions from groups of neurons in the two areas together or from one area alone. We will also adjust the visual stimulus to favor the tuning properties of neurons in each of the two areas to see whether the role of each area in decisions depends on the suitability of its neurons for the particular perceptual task. We hope that extending the study of decision-making to populations of neurons will improve our understanding of the underlying neuronal mechanisms and guide future experimental and theoretical work.\n",

      "Ã¯Â»Â¿   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Integral membrane proteins embed within the cellular membrane and perform crucial functions to modulate cellular transport, signaling, and anchoring. Although 20-30% of the proteins in the human proteome are membrane proteins, they represent less than 1% of the crystal structures in the Protein Data Bank despite of their biological importance. Increasing the number of solved membrane protein structures is extremely important to understand protein function, understand disease consequences due to protein misassembly, and increase potential drug targets. However, membrane proteins are insoluble in water and as a result their structural characterization is greatly inhibited by their inability to be reliably crystallized outside of the membrane environment. It is thus necessary to find novel methods to overexpress membrane proteins in order to facilitate structure determination.    The hypothesis of this project is that protein expression can be increased by enhancing the efficiency with which membrane proteins are integrated into the bilayer during translation. In both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, proteins are inserted into the membrane during translation by the Sec translocon protein-conducting channel. In eukaryotes, the ribosome docks to the cytoplasmic opening of the channel and transfers a nascent polypeptide chain into the translocon during translation. Depending on the recognition of particular signals, the protein is directed to either integrate with the membrane or translocate through it. However, correctly directing nascent peptides to one of these outcomes depends on both thermodynamic and kinetic factors and as a result proteins are frequently sorted incorrectly or misassembled. If protein expression requires the correct integration of nascent membrane proteins, then designing protein mutants that enhance integration efficiency should increase expression yields by correcting errors in translocon-mediated insertion.    We propose a hierarchical, multiscale simulation strategy to model the full pathway of co-translational membrane protein integration. The goals of this work are to: 1) predict experimentally-measurable protein expression yields using a coarse-grained model of membrane integration and 2) engineer mutants to optimize protein expression. To accomplish these goals, we will optimize a recently developed coarse-grained model that is able to reach the minute-long timescales necessary for quantifying integration efficiency. Results of this model will be compared to protein expression measurements in E. coli using protein homologs of different expression efficiency. Comparisons between simulation and experiments will be used to identify specific protein features that enhance expression. Iteratively refining the model and incorporating additional system properties, such as lipid composition and protein structure, will improve these quantitative predictions. These findings will have a broad impact on structural biology, drug targeting, and membrane protein characterization by significantly reducing the barrier to membrane protein crystallization.\n",

      "A distinctive characteristic of human learning is its capability to flexibly acquire a wide range of rich and complex forms of knowledge (e.g., first and second languages) and acquiring new and accumulated knowledge (e.g., learning physics is easier after having learned algebra). An adequate explanation of human learning must address how existing knowledge changes the way we learn so that we achieve knowledge goals and in specific contexts. This project aims to discover and specify how human learning processes operate differently under different contexts, depending upon what content is being learned. This research contributes to improved educational practices by specifying how learning processes are influenced by knowledge acquisition in a systematic and replicable way. This research will enhance our understanding of successful learning and optimal performance.The project explores learning processes by contrasting learning from retrieval practice and learning from studying examples. The goal of this project is to resolve and clarify how these processes compete for cognitive resources, including attention and working memory, in ways that depend on the knowledge content to be learned. This research examines (1) the learning processes involved in learning from retrieval practice and from worked examples, (2) how these learning processes work differently when applied to different knowledge content, and (3) the computational mechanisms of learning that give rise to learning different content. The researchers use a combination of experiments in which the learning approach is varied along with the materials being studied and machine learning models. It will demonstrate knowledge-learning dependence by showing that one learning process (e.g., retrieval practice) produces better learning outcomes than another (e.g., example encoding) in some knowledge contexts but the reverse occurs in other knowledge contexts. By implementing the studies as part of a machine learning architecture, this research will provide computational evidence and theoretical insight into the hypothesized knowledge-learning dependence framework. The machine learning architecture developed may be used as an educational and research tool in learning sciences, and the project involves training new learning scientists.This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\n",

While we have gained extensive knowledge regarding the mechanisms that determine the specificity of the adaptive immune response, very little is known about the mechanisms that determine the recognition of HIV-1 by the innate immune response. However, not only is the innate immune response critical in viral containment at a time when the adaptive immune response is just developing, it is also critical in shaping the function of the subsequent adaptive immune response. Therefore comprehensive studies aimed at deconstructing this early critical arm of the immune response, and its relationship to the adaptive immune response, are necessary to begin to more globally understand the correlates of protective immunity.

      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Continuous replacement and repair of adult epithelial tissues such as the skin, intestine, and lung depend on self-renewing stem cells which generate the specialized cells necessary for tissue maintenance. Recent work has shown that the local environment, or niche, in which stem cells reside is critical for their maintenance and function. Specifically, positioning of the stem cell within the niche exposes it to signals that promote its survival and maintenance and guide the production of specialized daughter cells that perform the normal tissue functions. Self-renewing cells that possess many normal stem cell properties have been identified in tumors, emphasizing that defining stem cell control mechanisms in normal tissues is important for understanding how stem cells contribute to cancer. Conversely, the idea of using stem cell therapeutics to treat diseases associated with stem cell loss, such as diabetes, and devastating injuries to tissues including the brain, spinal cord, or skin has generated enormous excitement. However, our lack of understanding of the mechanisms that regulate stem cells within their normal niches in vivo has hampered the advancement of these therapies for clinical applications. The goal of our proposed study is to understand how localized signals promote stem cell specification and maintenance within the niche. In mammals, like mice or humans, major technical challenges have made it difficult to identify adult stem cells within tissues, a problem that has prevented the identification of important signals that control stem cell behavior. Because of this, we are using the developing ovary in the fruit fly as a model system to directly examine epithelial stem cell regulation. Rapid progress has already been made in identifying components of the stem cell niche and specific genes that control stem cell behavior. Importantly, the genes identified so far also regulate stem cells in humans, suggesting that identifying new signals that control fly stem cell function will be broadly relevant. Using the fly ovary system, we recently found that integrins, a group of proteins that anchor cells in place, are important for maintaining epithelial Follicle Stem Cells (FSCs) within their niche. Without integrins, FSCs change shape, improperly divide and migrate, and lose their ability to function as stem cells. Similar defects are thought to contribute to cancer initiation, promotion, and progression in humans. Our data also demonstrates that FSCs produce a protein that is an important niche component. This novel finding suggests that many types of stem cells, perhaps including cancer stem cells, may have the capacity to initiate their own niche. The experiments proposed will define 1) how integrins participate in FSC regulation and 2) identify important genes and proteins that work together with integrins to control stem cell function. The outcome of these experiments will impact our understanding of epithelial stem cell function in general and also will have important implications for the development of techniques aimed at purifying stem cells for therapeutic use.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Our present aim is to define epithelial stem cell control mechanisms in the fly ovary, where specific stem cell regulatory genes and their functions will be determined using genetics, live imaging, and developmental techniques. Defining stem cell control mechanisms in normal tissues is important for understanding how stem cells contribute to cancer and for developing stem cell therapeutics to treat developmental defects, traumatic injury, or diseases associated with stem cell loss, including diabetes.\n",

      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed experiments will continue to assess consequences of early exposure to ethanol for responsiveness to ethanol later in development. In view of epidemiological evidence for relatively frequent exposure to ethanol among human infants as well as fetuses, and clinical evidence that prenatal exposure to ethanol in humans predicts ethanol abuse in adolescence and early adulthood, the proposed experiments are relevant to issues of adolescent initiation to ethanol as well as more proximal consequences of early ethanol exposure. Three circumstances of early ethanol exposure to be studied are in the form of three specific aims: (1) To examine consequences of fetal processing of ethanol's chemosensory attributes and those of a learned association between them and ethanol's pharmacological effects; (2) To determine consequences of postnatal nursing experience involving ethanol for subsequent responsiveness to ethanol's chemosensory attributes, sensitivity to ethanol's postabsorptive effects and self-administration of ethanol; (3) To assess longitudinally the interactive consequences of prenatal and early postnatal exposure to ethanol for subsequent ethanol sensitivity and learning about ethanol during the preadolescent and adolescent periods. Experiments will apply techniques developed and previously employed in our laboratories, providing a combination of relatively new methods of treatment and assessment with methods used for many years. The experiments will include systematic assessment of: fetal associative learning supported by the reinforcing effects of ethanol during prenatal ethanol exposure and the consequences for postnatal responsiveness to ethanol; the consequences of ethanol exposure during nursing for later responsiveness to ethanol, novel environments and motor challenges; and conditioned and unconditioned effects of combined ethanol exposure as a fetus and as a nursing infant on later learning about ethanol, acceptance of ethanol and response to socially induced acceptance of ethanol. Theoretical orientation for considering the consequences of early ethanol exposure is focused on learning induced by that exposure and motivational content of related early memories. Special concern is given to specific temporal windows following ethanol exposure that yield memories of specific motivational associates, and the effect of multiple, potentially interactive exposures to ethanol for later patterns of ethanol recognition and acceptance\n",

      "Title: Animal Imaging Core Recent advances in small animal imaging have substantially improved our ability to gain insights into disease progression without altering the biological systems. The small animal imaging facility at UNC currently houses nine major imaging equipments, including MRI (2), PET/CT (1), CT (1), SPECT (1), optical imaging (3), and ultrasound (1). In addition, skillful technical staff members to maintain and operate the imaging equipments and animal technicians to facilitate animal preparation for imaging and monitoring during imaging are available. Leveraging on these impressive resources, the small animal imaging (SAI) core aims to provide advanced imaging technology to facilitate the proposed projects. Specifically, two major imaging tasks will be carried out for the proposed projects, including to depict biodistribution of nanoparticles (Projects 1, 2, and 3) and to monitor and evaluate therapeutic efficacy of the proposed nanoparticles or treatment regimens (Projects 2, 3, and 4) using imaging methods. To accomplish the former task, both PET and optical imaging methods will be developed to more efficiently and accurately provide biodistribution information. For the latter task, four imaging modalities, including optical, CT, PET, and MRI will be used to monitor therapeutic efficacy. Finally, while the imaging capability in the small animal imaging facility is already impressive, our institution has committed additional funds to further augment the imaging program at UNC, including the establishment of an on-site cyclotron facility and the associated radiochemistry lab and the development of imaging registration approaches for multimodality imaging using microCT, MRI, and PET (Projects 2, 3 and 4). Together, we believe that the available technical expertise and well established infrastructure in the small animal imaging facility will greatly facilitate the success ofthe proposed projects.\n",

      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dysfunction of the vascular endothelium contributes to most cardiovascular, circulatory, and blood diseases. This is not surprising, as the endothelium is the central regulator of hemostasis, vascular development, angiogenesis, vasomotor tone, and the response to vascular injury and inflammation. We have used several complementary approaches during the past funding cycle taking advantage of our longstanding interest in endothelial cell differentiation and gene expression programs to fill in the gaps in our understanding of how endothelial cell destiny and phenotypic diversity are determined. Some of our most exciting findings during the previous funding cycle came from the results of using global gene expression analysis of differentiating endothelial cells to identify candidate genes that are responsible for vascular development. Through this approach, we established a comprehensive list of candidate genes associated with the development of the vascular system during embryonic stem cell differentiation in vivo. Many of the genes we identified in this study were predictable: growth factors, cell surface markers, transcription factors and members of several signal transduction pathways already known to be associated with vasculogenesis. However, we also discovered some new players, including members of the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) and Wnt signaling pathways. In addition, we identified and cloned the novel endothelial cell precursor-derived protein called BMPER, which has become a major focus of the Specific Aims proposed for our next funding cycle. In this funding cycle, we will explore in more detail the molecular roles of these proteins in modulating endothelial cell phenotypes, with a focus on BMP signaling pathways in the vasculature. The aims of the proposal are to (1) understand the diversity of molecular effects of BMPER in endothelial cells; (2) characterize the diversity of cellular effects of BMPER in endothelial cells; and (3) delineate the role of BMPER in regulation of vascular angiogenic signaling events and inflammation. The scope of this proposal is intended to address relevant biological and physiological questions using state of the art molecular biology techniques. Knowledge gained from this proposal should provide crucial information about endothelial cell development from multipotent precursors, blood vessel formation in health and disease, and endothelial cell-type specific gene expression. In addition, mechanisms for targeted gene delivery to endothelial cells and for disruption and angiogenesis in its pathologic forms may be revealed. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The endothelium plays a critical role in vascular development and pattern formation during embryogenesis, and endothelial cells regulate vessel wall homeostasis, tissue response to ischemia, and vascular regeneration through their effects on vasomotor function and inflammation, angiogenesis, and progenitor cell dynamics. Our overall goal is to determine the events that contribute to vascular differentiation and morphogenesis, with the anticipation that these same processes are recapitulated in angiogenesis-dependent events in the adult.\n",

ObjectiveThe objective of the Data Management and Analysis Core is to continue to provide data managementservices and statistical expertise to Program Project investigators in a wide range of data acquisition andanalysis activities. Integral to the goals of each project is the management and analysis of Core observational,interview, questionnaire, and behavioral data, as well as management and analysis of data from the individualprojects. Data management activities draw on the considerable resources of the Data Management andAnalysis Center (DMAC) at the Frank Porter Graham Child Development Center (FPG) at UNC and TheMethodology Center (TMC) at PSD. Specific Aims of the Data Management and Analysis Core are to:1) Implement the planned missing design in conjunction with the Executive Committee.2) Develop and maintain data management strategies that process data collected in the common protocol andthe individual projects efficiently and accurately.3) Design and maintain integrated databases of project and common protocol data.4) Develop and implement data analysis plans using innovative analytic methods for longitudinal dataincluding variable-centered and person-centered approaches to address research questions incollaboration with project investigators.5) To set in place a data archiving system for data sharing.These goals require the collaboration of experienced statisticians and computer programmers. The DMACprogrammers have expertise in all aspects of quantitative data management, from the entry and tracking ofdata to the generation of analysis files and statistical programming. The DMAC and TMC statisticianscollaborated with these and other investigators regarding design and statistical issues across many earlychildhood research projects. The Data Management and Analysis Core provides high level expertise to theProgram Project in each of these areas. The use of an experienced data acquisition and analysis center toprocess and analyze data across the projects will provide both high levels of quality control and costeffectiveness.A central data acquisition and analysis center is especially important for this Program Project because datafrom each project contributes to the common protocol for use by all projects in addressing their hypotheses.In particular, executive functioning and self regulation measures collected by Project I, classroom observationsand child cognitive/academic outcomes collected by Project II, and family process measures collected byProject III, and community measures from the core are primary predictor or outcome measures used inanalyses by all projects. Central coordination of data processing and analysis will ensure the consistent andtimely processing of these ÃÂ¿data^for-all- inyestigatgrsv Careful documentation of data scoring, including the reliability and distributions of summary variables, will facilitate the use of one project's data by other projectinvestigators.The services provided by the Data Management and Analysis Core pertain to almost all phases of theresearch including design, data collection, data entry, and analysis. The main advantage of having acentralized facility for data management and computing is the ability to provide coordinated services thataddress the wide range of issues involved in these activities. By coordinating data processing activities for allprojects, duplication of effort is reduced, efficiencies of data management and analyses are generated, andopportunities for higher level analysis across data sets from different projects are made available. Thus,maximum communication is obtained across all projects to further the understanding of data to be analyzed, aswell as the statistical procedures for those analyses. Furthermore, synergy among projects is enhancedthrough having the same programmers and statisticians working across projects.\n",

The study includes: (1) interviews with mothers and fathers at birth and again when children are 1, 3, 5 and 9 years old, (2) medical records for a subset of mothers and children at birth, (3) in-home assessments of children and their home environments when children are 3, 5, and 9 years old, (4) interviews with children at age 9, (5) interviews with teachers when children are 3, 5, and 9 years old and (6) DNA samples from mothers and children when children are age 9. The study also includes in-depth, longitudinal interviews with a subset of approximately 75 couples during the first four years after the child's birth. The study design called for a large oversample of births to unmarried parents, and thus the data are a valuable resource for studying health disparities among minority and economically disadvantaged populations. To date, more than 1300 researchers have downloaded the public use data, and Google Scholar lists 730 scholarly articles, theses, books, and abstracts using the FFS data for the period covered by the current NICHD grant, 2006-2011. We seek funding to conduct another round of interviews with mothers and children when children are 15 years old. Our specific aims are to:   Update information on children's health and development and collect new data on health and health risk behavior, school performance, and anti- and pro-social behavior when children are age 15   Update information on contextual factors, including families, neighborhoods, schools and peers, when children are age 15, including retrospective data on family experiences since the last interview  Collect saliva samples from 3,600 children at age 15 to be used for future methylation analysis Approximately 3600 mothers and 3100 children will be interviewed via phone. These phone interviews will be 55 minutes for mothers and 45 minutes for children. Five hundred adolescents will be interviewed in person for approximately 1 hour.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will extend the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study (FFS), a nationally representative, birth cohort study of approximately 4900 children born in large US cities (populations of 200,000 or more) between 1998 and 2000, by collecting data from mothers and adolescents when the children are 15 years old on children's health and health risk behavior, school performance, and anti- and pro-social behavior; on contextual factors, including families, neighborhoods, schools, and peers; and on methylation using saliva samples from 3600 children at age 15. Adolescence is a critical period in human development when children engage in both positive and negative behaviors that are known to have lasting consequences for future health and wellbeing. The new data will dramatically increase our knowledge of how children's experiences in early and middle childhood influence adolescent behaviors and, ultimately, health and wellbeing in adulthood.\n",

      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This proposal focuses on DNA repair enzymes and signaling proteins with multiple roles in cellular responses to DNA damage. We view these multitasking proteins as potential control nodes that may integrate DNA damage-specific signals and marshal the appropriate repair process(es) to the sites of DNA damage. A frontier area in the field of DNA repair is to understand how the biochemical pathways of DNA repair are coordinated with one another, in a manner analogous to other intracellular signaling pathways. Our immediate efforts are focused on 1) defining the mechanism of substrate selection by mammalian DNA ligase III in DNA damage responses, 2) creating a  chemical genetic switch  to shut off the NER pathway in order to explore other diverse functions of the repair endonuclease ERCC1-XPF, and 3) the enzymatic regulation of Sir2, a protein deacetylase with diverse activities, including DNA repair functions. We are using a structure-based approach to develop small molecule modulators of protein- protein interactions and enzymatic activities that can ultimately be used to probe the physical interactions and functional crosstalk between DNA repair pathways in living cells. Inhibitors of DNA repair activities may ultimately be useful in treating cancers that have become resistant to DNA crosslinkers, alkylating agents, and other DNA-targeted therapies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We are studying how damaged DNA is repaired. These repair processes are essential for the normal maintenance of our genetic blueprint, but they can also cause resistance to anti-cancer drugs that kill tumors by inflicting damage to DNA. A better understanding of basic DNA repair mechanisms could lead to the development of drugs used to temporarily switch off repair during cancer chemotherapy.\n",

      "Forest ecosystems in the northeastern U.S. provide many important water resource benefits to people living in the region, including high quality drinking water, a reliable supply of water year-round, and protection against flooding. We know that past fluctuations in climate and land use have caused important changes to the species composition and structure of these forests. However, scientists predict that climate change processes currently underway due to human activity will likely result in an even greater frequency and intensity of extreme climate events than experienced in the past, especially more severe droughts, flooding, and temperature extremes. We currently know very little about how such changes in climate conditions will impact the northeastern forests and the critical water resources they provide to local populations. For example, climate change may significantly alter the water cycle by influencing how much water trees use or by changing the species composition of forests. The primary objective of this project is to understand how different forest species in New Hampshire will respond to climate change in terms of their water use and impacts on water supply and water quality. Specifically, we will measure water use by three different species considered to be particularly sensitive to climate change: American Beech, Sugar Maple, and Yellow Birch, over the period of several years at several sites located in the White Mountains of New Hampshire. The results will be incorporated into models in order to make predictions of how these species will likely respond to future changes in climate in terms of their water use and impacts on the amount and timing of streamflow. This information can be used by local water resource managers to make more informed decisions about how to best manage forests for sustainable provisioning of hydrologic services such as reliable and clean water and flood mitigation. The results of this study will also be valuable to the public because it will help people understand how and why the forests are responding to climate change, and therefore allow them to participate more actively in the development and implementation of effective policies to enhance the capacity of communities in the region to adapt to, and mitigate the effects of, climate change impacts on forests and water.\n",

      "Ã¯Â»Â¿   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tumor heterogeneity poses a distinct challenge to effective treatment of cancer patients. Next generating sequencing over the past decade has revealed how the ways in which tumor heterogeneity leads to worse outcomes for patients, by enabling tumors to evolve and develop resistance to targeted therapies. This project aims to investigate the origins of tumor heterogeneity, making use of a mouse model system that is designed to enable the identification of distinct tumor subpopulations and genetic analysis of these populations. This project will combine the disciplines of tumor progression and metastasis, tumor microenvironment studies, and cancer genetics to provide novel insights into the nature of subpopulations within a tumor and evolution of these subpopulations during the course of a tumor's progression from a benign lesion to aggressively metastatic disease. It will be completed primarily by a graduate student with significant experience in mouse carcinogenesis models and next generation sequencing over the course of two years, under the supervision of a faculty sponsor with decades of experience with skin carcinogenesis and cancer genetics.  Objectives: This proposal will (1) study the nature of subpopulations of cells that are found in early tumors, determining whether they are separately arising tumor cells or come from the tumor's microenvironment; (2) determine the behavior and contributions of tumor subpopulations during the course of progression from benign to metastatic disease. This work will provide a foundation for the development of cancer therapies better suited to combatting deadly heterogeneous tumors. Two specific aims are proposed: Aim 1: Test hypothesis that tumors which contain multiple contributing populations are recruiting  normal  tissue from the microenvironment. This aim will study subpopulations that are present within tumors at the earliest stages of tumor development, with the goal of understanding their origins and the long-term contributions they make to the tumor. Aim 2: Determine clonality and growth dynamics of early- and late-stage tumor progression, including the timing of metastatic dissemination. This aim will study tumor subpopulations that develop after the tumor is initiated. Subpopulations will be labeled at 8, 16, or 24 weeks after tumor initiation and their behavior studied as the tumor progresses to malignancy and metastasizes. Labeling subpopulations at different time points will further allow interrogation as to when tumors metastasize, a question that has significant impact of patient treatment strategies.\n",

      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Older adults are at increased risk to develop prolonged pain and experience greater pain-related loss of physical and psychosocial function compared to younger cohorts. We propose that changes in endogenous pain modulatory capacity accounts for increased incidence of pain and disability in older adults. That endogenous pain modulation dysfunction is related to persistent pain is supported by a number of studies comparing chronic pain patients with healthy controls using a  pain-inhibition-by-pain  experimental model. Although this research group (and others) has shown age deficiencies using the  pain inhibits pain  model, other human laboratory models that are known to engage pain modulatory systems have not been tested across the lifespan, each potentially involving different mechanisms. The overarching goal of the proposed research is to characterize age-related changes in pain inhibitory and facilitatory function and to investigate the biopsychosocial mediators and clinical relevance of these changes. Our preliminary data suggest that sophisticated psychophysical methods reflecting net inhibitory or facilitatory effects are sensitive to changes across the lifespan and will provide a more comprehensive and clinically-relevant picture of changes in pain processing associated with aging. This proposed study will enroll 180 human subjects, ages 18-79, who will undergo assessment during three pain modulatory sessions at baseline. The pain modulatory tests will include inhibitory protocols; diffuse noxious controls and offset analgesia, and tests that involve pain facilitation; temporal summation, impaired decay of subthreshold pain (proxy for central sensitization), and a prolonged protocol which we have found produces greater temporal sensitization across repeated trials in older subjects. Individualized temperatures for the contact heat test stimulus will be used so that subjects experience similar, moderate levels of pain. We hypothesize that age will be associated with poorer endogenous pain inhibition from pain inhibitory protocols and increased pain from protocols that facilitate pain. A range of biopsychosocial markers will be measured that we hypothesize will mediate the association between age and variability in pain modulation. These measures include psychosocial factors (catastrophizing, sleep, stress, and negative emotions) and biological markers (blood pressure, 2-endorphin, cortisol, and other hypothalamic-pituitary- adrenal and immune markers). After establishing individual levels of pain facilitation and pain inhibition, we will assess pain during daily life and the impact of pain on quality of life using a series of telephone interviews and novel real-time electronic data capture each month for 6 months. We expect that changes in our pain modulatory tests will account for observed age differences in pain frequency, more pain intensity, number of pain sites, and in quality of life.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Older persons are at greater risk of developing prolonged pain, and when they do, they suffer a greater impact of pain on quality of life than younger persons. This study will employ cutting-edge pain testing techniques to test for changes in pain inhibitory capacity, which we hypothesize contribute to increased incidence of pain and disability in older adults. As a public health problem, the increase in numbers of elders expected in our nation's population in the coming decades render understand the mechanism behind increased pain among older adults a compelling area for research\n",

      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This SBIR Phase I project will develop novel polymers as a drug delivery carrier for pharmacological applications. The carrier is a highly-structured copolymer that can form micelle-like structures with the drug in aqueous media. The polymer/drug micelle contains specially tailored interaction functionalities for drug encapsulation and slow release. The features of this type of molecular structure will minimize early degradation of the encapsulated drug and the polymer carriers are fully diodegradable. The polymer/drug micelles will exhibit uniform size and drug loading levels, and a predictable, well-controlled drug release rate.  The overall objective in the Phase I program is to develop a drug delivery system based on the proposed copolymer for pharmacological applications, and to demonstrate the enhanced drug encapsulation capability and biodegradbility as a drug delivery carrier. The specific technical aims are: 1) to synthesize and characterize represenative polymer drug carriers; 2) to demonstrate the encapsulation of special drugs and slow drug release rate; and 3) to determine the polymer's biocompatibility.  Potential markets for drug delivery are highly significant. Many of these drugs have stability problems and undesirable side effects. With this proposed new drug delivery system, more efficient drug delivery with lower dosage is possible.  This will reduce untoward side effects and enable efficient drug therapy for disease treatment.    Public Health Relevance: This SBIR Phase I project will develop polymer drug delivery carrier for pharmacological applications such as anticancer treatment. The polymer/drug medication will minimize early degradation of the encapsulated drug and decrease harmful side-effects from premature drug release.\n",

      "TECHNICALA workshop, to be held in the University of California Santa Barbara in March 2011 on the topic of Materials by Design, is supported by programs in the Division of Materials Research (Solid State and Materials Chemistry and Condensed Matter Physics), Division of Chemistry (Macromolecular, Supramolecular, and Nanochemistry), and the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate (Office of Multidisciplinary Activities).  Research in Solid State and Materials Chemistry spans the full spectrum of exploration from constituent atoms, to bonding, to physical properties in extended materials. The strong links to physical properties and the functional behavior of materials is a key aspect that distinguishes solid state and materials chemists from other practitioners of chemistry, physics, and materials science: a unique approach that includes inorganic and organic materials research, incorporating both crystalline and amorphous materials, and probed at the deepest level. The goal is frequently to achieve the desired physical properties in materials that enable a given application. In this context, we employ the term Materials by Design (MbD) to refer to research that seeks to create new materials for specific applications by design. The materials may range from solution-prepared nanoparticles, to small-molecule and polymer advanced electronic materials, to organic/inorganic hybrid materials, bulk oxides, main-group compounds, and intermetallics.  One of the central goals of MbD is to make extensive routine use of computational techniques applied at multiple length scales to understand and predict new materials properties. Clearly, a vision for MbD needs to be inclusive and would rely heavily on collaboration with allied disciplines within Condensed Matter Physics (CMP) and Materials Science which will be discussed at this workshop.NON-TECHNICALThe workshop offers the opportunity for junior and senior researchers from the disciplines of chemistry, condensed matter physics, theory and materials science to come together and discuss new mechanisms for working together to advance the concept of Materials by Design.   The outcome of the workshop will be better approaches to materials discovery and a path to restoring the US to a position of preeminence in this area.\n",

      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goal of this project is to identify mechanisms that protect the nervous system from aging and neurodegenerative disorders. Aging precipitates dramatic alterations in the physiology of all organisms, compromising cellular function, reducing resistance to stress, and increasing the likelihood of developing age-related diseases. Characteristic conditions are late-onset neurodegenerative disorders and cognitive decline. Remarkably, while age is known to be a strong determinant of these conditions, the molecular mechanisms leading to natural age-related neural deterioration are virtually unknown. We propose a compelling approach to elucidate the mechanisms by which neurons age, how brain function is affected by aging and how, in turn, this is related to aging of the whole body. Through our research in a powerful genetic model organism we have uncovered, for the first time, the presence of genes that appear exclusively dedicated to protecting neurons and neuronal circuits from the effects of aging. These findings provide us with a unique entry point toelucidate the mechanisms of neuronal aging. We propose to use robust genetic aproaches in C. elegans, a model system with a strong track record of contributions to the field of aging and nervous system development and function, to tease apart the molecular mechanisms underlying normal age-dependent brain decline and neuropathological conditions manifested during senescence. We will achieve this by (1) establishing the progression of age-related changes in the nervous system and elucidating the role of the neuronal protection genes we have indentified during aging, (2) test the role of lifespan-determining pathways in neuronal aging, and (3) identifying new gene products that function to protect the nervous system from aging. Ultimately, we expect that this research will provide a much-needed paradigm-shifting strategy for the design of effective interventions to improve human life at old age and to ameliorate the consequences of neurodegenerative diseases and cognitive decline. 1  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: While mental decline and the onset of neurodegenerative diseases are strongly dependent on age, the mechanisms by which aging triggers these conditions is largely unknown. The goal of this project is to understand how brain cells age, how brain function is affected and how in turn this is related to aging of the whole body, with the major goal of uncovering strategies to counteract age-related brain decline. We predict that this research strategy will open up completely novel and powerful advances into our understanding of nervous system aging. Ultimately, these studies are expected to fully direct and speed up future research in mammalian systems, where genetic approaches to identify aging-related genes is still quite complicated. The proposed studies in C. elegans are expected to establish a strong foundation to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of neuronal aging, at the single- neuron, circuit, and circuit output (behavior) levels. We expect that our findings will foster the study of novel molecular mechanisms that control neuronal decline and its relationship to aging, which will dramatically enhance our understanding of the molecular codes used by neurons to actively protect neuronal function despite developmental, mechanical, and environmental challenges. We expect that our research will have fundamental implications for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases and the development of approaches to ameliorate the consequences of aging for cognition, thus improving the quality of human life at old age.\n",

      "--------------------\n",
      "Depression is a common psychiatric illness that often begins in adolescence and adds to high mental health costs in the United States. Some depression can be normal and short-lived, but having a depressive disorder in adolescence can lead to other mental illnesses such as anxiety disorders, substance abuse, and suicide in adolescence and adulthood. Thus, it is important to study depression during adolescence in order to identify risk factors for depressive disorders before functioning is impaired. The ways in which the body physiologically responds and adapts to stress has been linked with the development of depression. Little is known how these biological processes work in Mexican-origin youth, which is important given that Mexican-origin adolescents show higher rates of depression symptoms and diagnoses relative to peers of other racial/ethnic groups and suicide is the third leading cause of death among 10-20 year old Hispanics in the U.S. If it is not treated early, depression can lead to 1) repeated school absences/inability to finish school; 2) impaired peer relations; 3) low self-esteem; 4) alcohol/drug use; and 5) problems adjusting in the workforce. Despite this importance, depression in Mexican-origin youth has been understudied, particularly from a neurobiological perspective. It is only recently that non-invasive neuroimaging methods have been available for scientists to safely study neurobiology involved in depression. Using neuroimaging techniques and other methods to assess physiology in humans allows for a tighter integration between animal and clinical research on depression, provides a better understanding of the development of depression, and helps create better treatments for depression. This project will examine neurobiological data (e.g., brain function, immune function, cardiovascular physiology, and stress reactivity), psychiatric symptoms and diagnoses, and reports on family, peers, behavior and functioning in Mexican-origin adolescents who have elevated depressive symptoms. This approach will address new questions about the relationships between the brain and social contexts in the development of depression. If a specific profile of neurobiological functioning is associated with the symptoms of depression, then such assessments might be helpful for identifying youth with high risk for depression. The project&#39;s results will be analyzed, evaluated, and interpreted to provide informational sessions and workshops for parents, teachers, and clinicians as well as local mental health service providers and schools about depression and associated risk factors in youth.\n",

      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) is characterized by the infiltration of T-lymphocytes into the islets of Langerhans of the pancreas (insulitis), followed by selective destruction of insulin-secreting beta cells leading to overt diabetes. Preliminarily, we observed the important association of IDDM with AIM factor (a secretion molecule we initially identified as an apoptosis inhibitory factor), which are: (1) AIM [-/-] mice backcrossed to non-obese diabetes (NOD) background showed complete prevention of IDDM; (2) AIM is expressed by infiltrating macrophages in the pancreatic islets from the very early stage of the disease; (3) AIM strongly induces TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-6 and IL-12 in macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs). Based on these, a hypothesis has emerged that AIM may accelerate IDDM by inducing pro-inflammatory- and type I- cytokines in initially infiltrating macrophages and DCs in the islets at the onset stage of the disease. The Specific Aim 1 and 2 are focused on establishing the propriety of the hypothesis by adding back the AIM expression in macrophages in AIM-null NOD mice expecting the disease recurrence (aim 1), and testing the impact of the cytokines downstream of AIM signaling on the disease acceleration by assessing whether the induction of the cytokines in macrophages and DCs via the Tet-inducible transgenic system may overcome the disease prevention in AIM-null NOD mice (aim 2). In addition, our recent result that AIM mediates Toll-signaling to induce the cytokines provoked an idea that the putative AIM-receptor may be a TolI/IL-1 receptor family member. In the Specific Aim 3, we will purify and characterize the AIM-receptor by expression screening of a cDNA library generated from macrophage cells. We also plan to create knockout mice of the AIM-receptor by disrupting the gene in the NOD-derived ES cells, as we generated AIM[-/-]/-NOD by using the cells. Our proposed studies will clarify the precise picture of the IDDM pathogenesis in the context of AIM, in particular, during the early stage of the disease, and thus will contribute to development of a new therapy via suppression of AIM. In addition, identification of AIM-receptor will shed light on the precise molecular machinery of AIM functions, as well as a new aspect of physiological function of the Toll-family.\n",

      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Sleep is a highly conserved behavior that is required for proper health and cognition in all animals studied to date, yet a function for sleep has not been described. Drosophila melanogaster exhibits many of the hallmarks of mammalian sleep, including increased arousal threshold, consolidated immobility, and regulation by both circadian rhythm and a homeostatic drive. Although great strides have been made in recent years towards understanding the neural circuitry and molecular pathways that regulate circadian rhythm in Drosophila, the regulation of sleep by the homeostatic drive is poorly understood. In a recent screen for genes involved in regulating sleep behavior, we found that flies lacking a functional copy of the Rab GTPase, lightoid (ltd), sleep at least 200min per 24h less than background controls. In addition, work by others has suggested that (1) the expression of ltd is Clock-dependent, (2) the expression of ltd is sleep/wake-regulated, (3) ltd is required for proper long-term memory, and (4) ltd is a homologue of the human gene, Rab32, which functions to localize PKA, a known regulator of sleep. The goal of the proposed project is to better understand the mechanism by which ltd regulates sleep behavior by taking 3 approaches: (1) I will analyze 4 ltd alleles for several aspects of sleep behavior, including overall sleep duration, sleep bout length, number of sleep bouts, latency to sleep, sleep rebound after deprivation, and total life span. (2) I will analyze the regulation of ltd using a quantitative PCR approach to determine if ltd is regulated by circadian drive, the homeostatic sleep drive, or light. (3) To determine in which brain regions ltd is sufficient to perform its sleep-regulation role, I will perform a tissue-specific rescue experiment with several GAL4 drivers that drive expression in known sleep-regulating areas of brain. The work proposed here will provide a better understanding of how the new sleep gene, ltd, regulates sleep. Furthermore, based on its connections to the molecular clock, learning & memory, and PKA, the proposed investigation of ltd could provide a molecular link between these disparate aspects of sleep biology. Finally, this work will identify ltd as an excellent candidate to aid in the diagnosis of sleep disorders such as insomina and somnabalism, as well as a potential drug target to offer treatment. We are interested in the function and regulation of sleep. Currently, we use the fruitfly, an animal that has recently been shown to be an excellent model for sleep behavior, to help understand how neural circuits control sleep/wake behavior, as well as to identify new genes that could be used to identify and treat sleep disorders in humans.\n",

      "Objective Rationale:  Breast cancer is the most common type of cancer among women in the United States and is the second leading cause of cancer death among women.  While mortality rates are decreasing due to early detection and successful therapies, breast cancer deaths is still a staggering 40,000 per year, underscoring the continued need for more effective therapeutic strategies.  Research has shown that dysregulation of receptor tyrosine kinases plays a prominent role in breast cancer initiation, progression, and metastasis.  Data from our lab and others have demonstrated that epithelial cell differentiation, survival, and growth in ductal and secretory epithelium require the function of ErbB3 and ErbB4 neuregulin receptors.  Molecular analysis has revealed the existence of several clinical breast cancer subtypes, with the molecular phenotype potentially representing the cell type from which the breast cancer originated.  This application aims to address the hypothesis that neuregulin signaling drives luminal fate of breast epithelial cells and influences the therapeutic response of breast cancers.  My research will dissect the mechanisms by which neuregulin signaling contributes to luminal cell fate decisions in the untransformed breast, providing a platform to understand breast health.  These studies will also reveal fundamental signaling pathways that are critical for development and will uncover the earliest steps in the process of breast cancer, allowing us to begin to develop therapeutic strategies to prevent breast cancers.  Lastly, our research will be instrumental in understanding the protective role of parity against postmenopausal breast cancers and neuregulin signaling on anti-estrogen resistance of luminal cancers.Career Goals:  Since an early age, I have been interested in breast cancer research, and this interest was refined and developed in my undergraduate studies as I began to learn how molecular alterations can drive breast cancer.  Further, my commitment to breast cancer research is demonstrated by my decision to stay in the breast cancer research field as a postdoctoral fellow upon completion of my predoctoral thesis studying metastasis of breast cancer to the bone.  My career goal is to lead an independent translational breast cancer research program that will make a positive impact on breast cancer patient care, the breast cancer research community, and on future scientists through improved treatment strategies and effective preventive strategies.  I plan to gain tangible skills during the time of this application with mouse models of cancer and combining these studies with cell culture molecular approaches to determine how best to prevent and treat breast cancer.The proposed training plan will provide me with the opportunity to expand my research skills, particularly in the areas of mouse models of breast cancer and parity involvement in breast cancer.  My mentor, Dr. Cook, received training as a developmental biologist and thus approaches breast cancer research through trying to understand developmental events that contribute to breast cancer formation and how these can be targeted to prevent breast cancer.  We have recruited additional senior scientists, Dr. Carlos Arteaga and Dr. Al Reynolds, from Vanderbilt to serve on my mentoring committee and assist in my professional development and research focus during the time of this application.  Aside from meeting with this committee twice yearly, I will also present my work at multiple meetings and seminars supported by the Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center Breast Program as well as the National Cancer Institute/National Health Institutes-funded Breast Cancer SPORE (Specialized Program of Research Excellence).  Additionally, my primary mentor and Dr. Arteaga have joint lab meetings, giving me the opportunity to present my data more often at these weekly lab meetings.  My co-mentor, Dr. Arteaga, is the director of the Breast Cancer SPORE and a leader in translational breast cancer research.  Thus, his guidance will undoubtedly help expedite the findings from this proposal to improving treatment options for breast cancer patients.  Taken together, this training plan will ensure my training in translational breast cancer research and will provide me with essential tools to establish myself as an independent investigator.  Successful completion of the proposed work will place me in an excellent position to pursue an independent, extramurally funded career in breast cancer research.Application of Research:  This application aims to address the function of neuregulin signaling in the untransformd mammary gland as it leads to influencing breast cancer phenotypes.  Heterogeneity in breast cancer can often be traced back to epithelial lineages and precursor cells.  This project is designed to define how neuregulin signaling affects cell specification, growth, and maintenance of the mammary gland and how these physiological processes are commandeered during breast tumorigenesis, thus offering a better understanding for development of therapies to target neuregulin signaling.\n",

      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The care of patients with complex healthcare needs is often fragmented because they receive care from multiple providers across disparate care locations and because information related to this care is frequently not transmitted between providers or locations. Inadequate inter-provider communication and care coordination significantly lessen care quality and compromise patient safety. This three-year project seeks to improve outcomes, quality and coordination of care for patients with complex healthcare needs by facilitating the availability of information following three types of care transitions into the ambulatory care setting. Specifically, information regarding care transitions will be made available to patients, primary care practitioners and care managers following hospitalizations, emergency department (ED) encounters, and specialty clinic evaluations. This project will build upon a regional Health Information Exchange (HIE) network created to connect providers serving 42,000 Medicaid beneficiaries across traditional institutional boundaries from both rural and urban settings in a 6 county region in the Northern Piedmont of North Carolina. This network includes 25 ambulatory care practices, 3 federally qualified health centers, 4 rural health clinics, 3 urgent care facilities, 11 government agencies, 5 hospitals and 2 cross-disciplinary care-management teams. Within this HIE network, 4,608 patients with complex healthcare needs have been identified. For this project, a standards-based clinical decision support tool will be utilized in order to ensure that the proposed approach is generalizable, portable, and scalable, and routinely available claims and scheduling data will be used as the primary data source. This approach will support both traditional clinic-based models of care as well as new care models including population health management and the use of cross-disciplinary teams. Under Aim 1, the existing HIE network and decision support tool will be enhanced to enable detection of transitions in care and delivery of timely, patient-specific information regarding these care transitions to patients, primary care clinicians and multidisciplinary care management team members. Under Aim 2, the impact of the proposed approach will be evaluated in a randomized controlled trial involving approximately 4600 patients, 309 primary care clinicians, and 31 care management workers. Patients with complex healthcare needs will be randomly assigned by family unit to one of three groups: 1) information on care transitions sent to patients and their clinic-based caregivers; 2) information sent to patients, their clinic-based caregivers and their care managers; and 3) no information sent. The primary outcome measure will be the overall rate of ED utilization for each study group. Under Aim 3, the economic attractiveness of the proposed approach will be determined. Under Aim 4, the technology and results of this study will be disseminated through public media, publications and presentations. Information-augmented care transitions between sites should result in improved care coordination, higher quality of care, and more appropriate care.\n",

      "1133162, PikovThe ICNPD-2011 conference will bring together international investigators of all levels to Sidney, Australia in order to discuss recent research findings and to establish new collaborations in the new and exciting field of neural prosthetic devices. The conference will take place on November 26-27, 2011. It will be preceded by a series of online discussions by the organizing committee, resulting in the selection of several key innovation challenges in the field that will be addressed at the conference. This proposal aims to expand the participation of junior US researchers at the conference by subsidizing their travel costs. Intellectual MeritThe overall conference theme will be the technological and biological challenges in translating the neural prosthetics into clinic. There are multiple research groups worldwide involved in development and testing of neuroprosthetic implants for a variety of neurological disorders and similar difficulties often arise in selecting biocompatible encapsulation materials, in applying modern wireless communication technology, in better understanding of clinical and user needs, etc. Several discussion panels will be held at the conference to stimulate the interaction of participants in seeking the solutions for these prevailing challenges, rather than simply reporting on the progress from the laboratories. An additional emphasis of the conference will be upon identifying the areas of possible collaborations between the US and Australian scientists and finding the mechanisms for jump-starting these collaborations. There are multiple opportunities for the researchers to initiate productive collaborative projects in the development and testing of devices for the hearing and vision loss, muscle paralysis, Parkinson?s disease, epilepsy, and other neurological disorders. The conference described in this proposal is one that will bring together established investigators and early-career researchers just entering this field. To enable a focused exchange at the discussion panels during the two-day meeting, there will be a series of brainstorming online discussions preceding the conference.Broader ImpactThe conference can inform the NSF about new developments in the rapidly growing neural prosthetics field. A specific goal of the NSF that will be aided by the conference is the establishment of new programs which emphasize integration of neural technology research and medical device industry. The conference will provide a good opportunity to highlight best practices in this area and to bring lessons from this experience to the NSF initiatives. The conference participants will be selected to represent a broad spectrum of interested participants from academia, national laboratories, government, and industry. Recruitment of participants representing researchers at all stages in their careers from well established to new researchers just starting their career will be actively pursued. A special effort will be made to increase the representation of women and underrepresented minorities at the conference. The conference program, poster and talk abstracts will be posted on the conference website as well as on Frontiers Conferences, a premier online depository for the conference proceedings in theneuroscience-related fields (www.frontiersin.org/conferences), to serve as a practical educational tool. In addition, the selected short papers, submitted to the conference, will be peer-reviewed and published as a special issue of the open-access journal Frontiers in Neuroscience.\n",

      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Patients with insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM; Type 1 diabetes) display higher bone loss and increased risk for osteoporosis and related bone fractures. However, the mechanisms that underlie bone loss in IDDM are still not fully understood. It is well established that bone mass is maintained by bone remodeling, a process that involves formation of new bone by osteoblasts and osteocytes and resorption of existing bone by osteoclasts. Bone remodeling is regulated by mechanical stimuli imposed continuously to the skeleton by physical activity, and proper response of osteocytes/osteoblasts to mechanical loading is thus essential for maintenance of bone function and skeletal integrity. The main goal of this R01 application is to test the novel hypothesis that altered expression of components of bone mechanosensory and transduction systems is a central mechanism leading to bone cell dysfunction and higher bone loss in IDDM. For this we will use comprehensive in vitro studies with bone cell lines that will be uniquely combined with in vivo bone physiology and in situ bone tissue analysis on the Type 1 diabetic Akita mouse model. The proposed in vitro studies will provide mechanistic insights into effects of high glucose on bone cell detection and response to mechanical stimuli. The in vivo and ultimate in situ studies with control age- matched and Akita mice treated with or without insulin will determine the impact of diabetes and associated high glucose on bone formation in response to mechanical loading, and evaluate the contribution of altered bone mechanosignaling to the higher bone loss in diabetes. These studies will be directed by a new investigator who has a background in biomedical engineering and has begun a first faculty appointment in a Department of Orthopaedic Surgery. Studies will combine the broad expertise of junior and senior researchers in the areas of biomedical engineering, pharmacology, physiology and molecular biology, and state-of-the-art biochemical, live cell imaging, histomorphometric studies and non-invasive in vivo whole animal bone imaging. The proposed studies are not only expected to advance understanding of mechanisms underlying diabetic osteopenia, highlighting the deleterious effects of high glucose on bone mechanosensory/transduction systems, but will also bring awareness to the importance of an early and tight glycemic control to prevent and reverse bone loss in diabetes.\n",

      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Lung diseases, including lung cancer and chronic lung diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, together account for some 280,000 deaths annually (American Lung Association). Contributing to this mortality is the fact that remediation of all forms of lung disease is hampered by the limited ability of lung to regenerate. Hence, lung tissue that is damaged by degeneration or infection, or lung tissue that is surgically resected, is not functionally replaced in vivo. Currently, the only way to replace lung tissue is to perform lung transplantation, an expensive procedure that is achieves only a 10% survival at 10 years, and one that is hampered by a severe shortage of organs.  Over the past 3 years, we have worked to address some fundamental challenges in lung tissue engineering. In order to produce a lung scaffold that has suitable geometry and mechanics for lung regeneration, we have developed technologies to decellularize entire lung tissues. We have shown that these acellular lung matrices retain the gross mechanical properties of the original lung tissues, and provide outstanding support for the adhesion and growth of epithelial and vascular cells. We have developed a novel,  biomimetic  bioreactor that provides for long-term sterile lung culture, circulation of nutrient medium through the lung vascular compartment, and  breathing  of nutrient medium into the airway. As a cell source to repopulate the acellular lung matrix, we have utilized syngeneic neonatal rat lung cells, as these cells show significant potential for growth inside the developing lung. We have made substantial and exciting progress in this work, and have shown the feasibility of regenerating many characteristics of lung tissue, but there remain several important issues that must be studied and addressed before the functionality of such lung tissues can be tested in vivo. Most fundamentally, in order to exchange gas, the lung must comprise sufficient alveolar diffusional surface area, must be populated with functional and differentiated epithelial cell subsets at correct anatomic locations in the alveoli and elsewhere, and must be invested with a functional microvasculature that withstands physiological perfusion pressures and does not leak fluid into the alveolar compartment. In this proposal, we will study and refine the lung tissue engineering system in order to address each of these issues and advance the central mission of functional lung regeneration, which is the capacity for effective gas exchange. We hypothesize that the acellular lung matrix, when suitably re-populated with lung epithelium and vascular cells, will support the growth and differentiation of these cells and will produce a tissue that is effective for gas exchange, based upon in vitro measurements.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Lung diseases, including lung cancer and chronic lung diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, together account for some 280,000 deaths annually. Over the past 3 years, we have worked to address some fundamental challenges in lung tissue engineering in order to provide lung tissue replacements for patients with lung disease. We hypothesize that an acellular lung matrix, when suitably re-populated with lung epithelium and vascular cells, will support the growth and differentiation of these cells and will produce a tissue that is effective for functional gas exchange.\n",

      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This proposal seeks to identify the exact step(s) of adenovirus (Ad) infection that is (are) responsible for the initiation of an anti-Ad acute inflammatory response upon systemic virus application. Over the last two decades numerous Ad-based vectors have been developed for gene therapy applications and many are currently being tested in clinical trials. Most recently, interest in Ad has further expanded due to its potential as a vector for vaccination against life threatening infectious agents such as anthrax. While natural infections with Ad are largely harmless to humans, intravenous Ad administration may result in a severe inflammatory response, which can lead to fatal outcomes. It is currently recognized that the initiation of this acute systemic inflammation depends on interactions of the Ad capsid with host cells. Despite significant knowledge regarding Ad interactions with cells in vitro, the molecular mechanisms governing Ad bio-distribution, hepatic tropism and toxicity in vivo remain poorly understood. Recently, we identified a novel blood factor-dependent pathway of Ad liver cell infection in vivo. This finding explained the observed Ad biodistribution in animals after systemic application and is fundamental for the development of novel strategies to modify both Ad tropism in vivo and virus-associated toxicity. In mouse models, we will analyze the innate immune response to intravenously applied capsid-modified Ad mutants deficient in their ability to undergo the initial steps of virus infection. Our specific aims are to analyze the role of Ad interactions 1) with primary attachment receptors; 2) with integrins, which facilitate Ad initialization; or 3) with cellular factors upon virus escape from endosomes, in the initiation of an anti-Ad inflammatory response. Based on the data obtained, in our fourth specific aim we will construct ah Ad vector ablated for binding to known virus receptors and capable of infecting cells via an alternative receptor, LDLR. By applying this vector in mice and evaluating its toxicity we will test the hypothesis that modification of the Ad capsid represents a feasible approach to reduce acute Ad-mediated inflammation while preserving virus gene transfer ability upon systemic application. These studies will significantly improve our understanding of fundamental mechanisms of the host defense against viral pathogens and may ultimately lead to the development of safe and efficient Ad vectors for the therapy of a wide range of inborn and acquired human diseases.\n",

      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Many phenotypes are encoded in the genome of an organism, and the first step in the expression of these phenotypes is the transcription of a gene into RNA. Essentially, the phenotype of the organism is shaped by the transcription of specific genes in specific cell types, at specific points in development, and in a specific sex. Coupling gene expression with genome sequences from multiple species allows for a high resolution examination of the evolutionary dynamics of the regulation of transcription. High quality gene expression data will be collected from three somatic tissues and the gonads of males and females of four species of Drosophila to test hypotheses regarding the evolution of gene expression. These data will be used to determine the plasticity or conservation of gene expression for individual genes. Additionally, the expression profiles of duplicated genes will be examined to determine how gene expression is partitioned following duplication and how often duplicated genes obtain new functions. Finally, comparisons will be made between genes on X chromosomes and those on autosomes to determine what causes the differences in sex-bias between these two classes of chromosomes. Relevance: While many genetic diseases are caused by mutations that disrupt the proper functioning of a gene product, many others are caused by a gene not being expressed properly. The proposed research will address a few of the major factors responsible for determining how genes are expressed using the Drosophila model system. These factors will be analyzed on a genome-wide scale to study how the genomic context in which a gene is found affects how that gene is expressed throughout the organism.\n",

      "Ã¯Â»Â¿   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Prostate cancer is a heterogeneous disease with significant variations in its clinical outcome. Current methods to assess prostate cancer risk combine prostate specific antigen (PSA) screening and random prostate biopsy. Unfortunately, this strategy fails to reveal the lesion's location and does not accurately differentiate between aggressive and non-aggressive prostate cancers. As a result, most patients will receive unnecessary active treatment for low-risk prostate cancer in order to avoid under treatment. Active treatment involves surgery or radiation, often causing long-term side effects such as urinary incontinence, erectile dysfunction, or bowel urgency. Therefore, non-invasive and accurate diagnostic methods to determine the location of prostate cancer and to assess its immediate risk are needed.  The mission of Prostate Theranostics is to address this problem by developing targeting MRI contrast enhancing agents specific to an extracellular matrix (ECM) protein, oncofetal fibronectin (onfFN), for early accurate detection of prostate cancer. These agents would also be fitted with Gd(III)-chelates that would allow their location to be visualized within men's prostates using MRI. MRI is a non-invasive clinical diagnostic technique and can provide three-dimensional images of whole prostate with a resolution as high as 100 ÃÂµm. Recent studies show that the over expression of extracellular matrix proteins within prostate tissue are correlated to prostate cancer aggressiveness. In addition, these proteins can be targeted using specific peptide sequences. This project proposes to develop MRI contrast-enhancing agents with specific peptide sequences. These targeting probes would then bind to aggressive prostate cancer after intravenous injection. In addition, the clinician would be able tovisualize location of human prostate cancer using MRI.  The objectives of this SBIR Phase I project are to further optimize the targeted contrast-enhancing agent and commercialize the agent for clinical imaging prostate cancer. Non-invasive accurate detection of prostate cancer is an unmet clinical need for prostate cancer management. Successful development of our imaging technology has the potential to accurately detect and diagnose prostate cancer, replace invasive prostate biopsy, and improve decision-making in clinical management of prostate cancer. It also has the potential for non-invasive active surveillance of prostate cancer and timely monitoring of disease progression, as well as image-guided surgery and therapy.\n",

      "It is widely accepted that systems engineering is a key element of all large engineering projects; however, one estimate is that the Department of Defense alone loses about $200 million per day as a result of poor systems engineering, and other Federal agencies acknowledge that they cannot meet their projected missions using current systems engineering practices.  There has been a proliferation of calls for systems engineering, including the Secretary of Defense and the National Academies.  Simultaneously over the past 25 years, elements of a theory of systems engineering have emerged.  These elements point to an opportunity to formulate systems engineering as a rigorous engineering discipline.  The elements span mathematics, economics, business, and psychology, as well as significant elements of engineering and the sciences.  Numerous Universities and professional societies offer diverse educational programs and certifications in systems engineering.  This workshop on systems engineering education will assist in the unification of these disparate perspectives and help the systems engineering community move forward via improving the overall systems engineering education function.A survey of systems engineering related programs identified a diversity of systems engineering educations programs, without a consensus on how to create better systems engineering processes and the associated underlying educational foundations.  The primary purpose of the workshop is to investigate the future of systems engineering education and not conduct a review of the history nor the current state of systems engineering education, but a look forward.  The workshop will bring the leaders of the systems engineering community in the US together to investigate the following issues:  1) the needs of government and industry in terms of the tasks and roles that belong to systems engineering, 2) the elements of the skill and knowledge sets required to meet the systems engineering needs, 3) the organization of these elements into coherent systems engineering curricula at all levels, 4) the underlying theories that provide the needed skill and knowledge sets and that will form the basis of systems engineering education, and 5) the knowledge gaps that need to be researched that would enhance systems engineering education.

      "The discovery of antibiotics nearly 80 years ago was a major milestone in the battle against infectious disease, yet bacterial infections continue to be a significant cause of death worldwide. In fact, management of many bacterial infections is becoming progressively more difficult due to the emergence of new and rapidly evolving pathogens with increased virulence, resistance to antibiotics, a greater ability to evade host responses, and heightened transmissibility. To reverse this trend, a systematic understanding of the complex dynamics between the pathogen and host is needed at every level of interaction, including those between cells, individuals, microbial communities, and populations. We will develop and implement an integrated experimental framework that provides systematic and complementary insights into bacterial infections encompassing single cells, animal models, and human patients, to investigate cellular genomics, transcriptional networks, and host microecologies. Three of the most deadly and costly bacterial pathogens will be used as examples to develop this framework and probe the host-pathogen interaction. Specifically, we will dissect the interaction between Mycobacterium tuberculosis and its host at the single cell level to gain a deep and highly resolved characterization of the host cellular states that contribute to susceptibility to infection. We will follow the dynamics of uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) infection in animals and humans to gain insights into the role of UPEC, the host and the host microbiome in the persistence of recurrent urinary tract infections. We will track the movement and evolution of carbapenem resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) as they emerge in patient populations contributing critical details about how CRE and the resistance elements that they carry are transmitted among patients and patient populations. There are two goals of this work. One is to develop an adaptable framework of multi-omic approaches to be applied to a wide-range of pathogens for the dissection of bacterial infection at the single cell, infected individual and clinical population levels. The second is to capitalize on the output from this framework to identify points\n",

      "DESCRIPTION: The Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act provides a unique opportunity for the FDA to affect an enormous improvement in public health. Granted the authority to regulate levels of nicotine, the key addictive agent in tobacco products, the FDA is i a position to help solve the problem of tobacco smoking, the leading contributor to preventable death and disease in the U.S. with an annual death toll of >400,000 individuals. Despite previous success in reducing the prevalence of smoking nationally, tobacco smoking has stabilized at about 19% of the adult population. Of even greater concern, young adults (18-25 years old) are the age group with the highest smoking prevalence in the U.S., at 34%. In order for the FDA to meet its stated priority of  reducing addiction to tobacco products , there are a number of crucial scientific questions that must be answered. Specifically, the FDA must be provided with data necessary to determine (1) the optimal level of nicotine yield in a cigarette toreduce smoking and tobacco dependence while still alleviating nicotine craving and withdrawal, and (2) how reduction to different nicotine yields would affect large subpopulations of smokers and possibly produce unintended consequences. It is vital that the FDA has comprehensive information available to support the goal of reducing nicotine yield. While some literature has documented behavioral responses to cigarettes of various nicotine yields, very little research is available to document cognitive and neural responses to reduced-nicotine cigarettes. Even less of this information is available in young adults, the age group most likely to be affected by nicotine reduction strategies.  The goal of this project is to advance tobacco regulatory science by testing the effects of reduced nicotine-yield cigarettes in young adult (18-25 years old) smokers. Using a within-subjects, counterbalanced design, the proposed study will therefore characterize the effects of smoking research cigarettes with varying nicotine yields (<0.05, 0.1, 0.282, or 0.68 mg nicotine) as compared with the participant's preferred-brand cigarette as the first cigarette of the day. Participants will be young (18-25 years old) adult daily smokers, teste following overnight abstinence. Self-reports of how they evaluate the experience of smoking the different cigarettes, including satisfaction, liking, relief of craving, and nicotine withdrawal wil be obtained. Also measured will be how the cigarettes affect the ability to sustain attention, a cognitive function that is impaired in abstinent smokers. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) will be used to provide a brain biomarker of the response to the different nicotine yields which can further inform understanding of the subjective and cognitive effects.  This work will provide novel, critical data to guide tobacco regulatory policy, will advance the field of tobacco regulatory science, and will establish innovative scientific methodology for future evaluation of tobacco products from a regulatory perspective.\n",

      "The residents of the study area, approximately 8000 people aged at least 5 years, have participated in a longitudinal population study since 1965, allowing study of the risk factors and effects of diabetes mellitus. Risk factors for obesity, hypertension, and nephropathy are also studied, along with the relationships of these diseases to diabetes and their effects on development of vascular complications and mortality. The genetics of diabetes is studied by means of family studies and relationships of genetic markers to disease. The roles of obesity, serum insulin concentrations, impaired glucose regulation, occupational and leisure-time physical activity and diabetes in relatives are assessed.  Findings on risk factors for diabetes are applied to a multicenter randomized clinical trial of prevention of type 2 diabetes that is currently in a long-term outcomes phase (the Diabetes Prevention Program Outcomes Study).  Studies of the genetics of type 2 diabetes, obesity, and diabetes complications are described in other projects.Knowledge of diabetes risk factors coming from this and other studies led to the hypothesis that type 2 diabetes could be prevented or delayed in adults at high short-term risk.  This hypothesis was confirmed in the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP), a multicenter randomized clinical trial in which many of the participants and investigators in this project participated.  We are now in a long-term follow-up phase, the Diabetes Prevention Program Outcomes Study (DPPOS), to assess long-term success with weight loss, reduction in the incidence of diabetes, and effects on diabetes complications.  The DPPOS also began a genetics component to test whether genes with known or suspected effects on type 2 diabetes affected diabetes incidence in the DPP and interacted with study interventions.\n",

      "G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) play critical roles in biologically and medically important signaling; however, the molecular mechanisms of activation of intracellular G proteins by ligand-bound GPCRs are not understood. The yeast pheromone response pathway provides an example of GPCR signaling that can be genetically manipulated in ways that would be impossible in other types of cells, yet components of this pathway are functionally interchangeable with corresponding components of mammalian systems. This project will use genetic approaches only possible in yeast to pursue a step-by-step dissection of the mechanisms of GPCR signaling by heterologously expressed somatostatin type 2 receptor and the endogenous yeast receptor for the a-mating pheromone, two receptors that can activate the same G protein but share no sequence similarity. The aims of the project are: I. Identification of sites of G protein interaction with receptors. To address the question of how activation of a GPCR leads to nucleotide exchange by a G protein and to map the interfaces between the two types of receptors and G proteins, a genetic screen will be conducted to identify mutations in G protein subunits that specifically prevent the interaction with receptors and mutations in receptors that specifically compensate for defects in G protein subunits. II. Identification of the conformational changes that constitute receptor activation. A new technique for pair-wise random introduction of cysteine residues will be used to screen for mutant receptor alleles that are locked in the activated state by disulfide bonds as a way of identifying sites that undergo intramolecular motion upon activation of receptors. III. Identification of ligand-receptor interactions mediating responses to different types of ligands. Screens will be conducted to identify mutant somatostatin receptors with altered responses to certain ligands and altered somatostatin ligands with altered effects on signaling. The goal is to identify particular sites of ligand-receptor interaction that are specific for activated and un-activated states of the receptor. IV. Determination of effects of receptor oligomerization on signaling and identification of sites of receptor-receptor interaction. A new flow cytometry-based assay will be used to screen libraries of randomly mutagenized receptors to identify amino acid substitutions that specifically block receptor oligomerization. The mutant receptors will then be used to determine the effects of oligomerization on signaling function.\n",

      "Obesity is one of the most serious health problems in the United States affecting about 33% of adult Americans 20-74 years old. Morbidity and mortality increases significantly with increasing weight, especially with abdominal obesity. The increased morbidity and mortality results primarily from increased incidence of cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension, stroke and coronary artery disease. Obesity is also associated with abnormal insulin levels, diabetes mellitus, and lipid abnormalities. However there is very limited information about the possible mechanisms by which obesity may lead to increased risk for cardiovascular diseases. A more thorough understanding of physiological relationship between overweight and cardiovascular disease would be facilitated by identification of an appropriate experimental model exhibiting important characteristics associated with human obesity and yet suitable for study of cardiovascular function. We hypothesize that diet-induced obesity in rats produced by feeding a high fat diet will exhibit characteristics of human obesity including hypertension and biomarkers of cardiovascular disease. This research is aimed to obtain baseline data for developing research examining the role dietary fat in regulation of blood pressure, lipid metabolism and biomarkers of cardiovascular disease in obesity. Obesity will be induced by feeding a high-fat, high-Calorie diet in rats. This model of obesity is similar to that which occurs in human consuming high-Calorie, high-fat diets. Rats that become obese are those gaining at least 20% more weight (DIO) than the average weight gain of the entire group. Rats that are resistant to developing obesity are those gaining at least 20% less weight (DR) than the average weight gain. Three different diets containing normal level of fat, high level of fat from beef tallow or high level of fat from fish oil will be fed to DIO and DR rats for 10 weeks. Blood pressure, blood and tissue lipid profile and blood levels of insulin, cardiovascular disease biomarker, CRP and obesity-associated hormone, leptin will be measured. The information generated from this study will be used for education of public for prevention of obesity associated cardiovascular health problems and increase of consumer awareness about dietary fat and health.\n",

      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): All organisms must protect their internal system from cellular stress. Whether stress arises from external toxins or mutation and disease, cells must sensitively monitor stress signals and mount the appropriate responses to maintain internal homeostasis. Despite the importance of stress defense, much remains unknown about the mechanisms eukaryotes use to survive stressful situations. Functional genomics has uncovered functions for many genes in various genomes, largely by characterizing gene function under standard conditions. However, a substantial fraction of genes remains uncharacterized, and many of these are likely to be involved in stress defense and thus have not been uncovered through traditional studies. This proposal will use high-throughput functional genomics, genomic expression analysis, computational biology, and techniques in genetics and biochemistry to identify and characterize genes involved in stress defense in yeast. Aim 1 will exploit two new phenotypes related to stress defense to uncover novel genes involved in eukaryotic stress survival. The first is a phenomenon known as `acquired stress resistance', in which cells exposed to a small dose of one stress become resistant to an otherwise lethal dose of a different stress. The second is a phenomenon in which cells retain a `memory' of stress resistance that persists for many generations after mild-stress treatment, even after the mild stress has been removed. We will use these phenotypes in high-throughput selections to identify yeast deletion mutants that cannot acquire or retain resistance to severe stress after mild-stress treatment. Identified genes, as well as known regulators of acquired stress resistance, will be characterized to define their precise roles in these phenomena. Cells respond to stress with a multi-facetted response. This response, including reorganization of genomic expression, is coordinated by a complex signaling network that responds to stress. Aim 2 will elucidate the intricate stress-activated signaling network in yeast that orchestrates genomic expression responses to stress. Regulators of stress-dependent genes will be identified by screening the yeast-deletion library for mutants unable to induce expression upon stress treatments. Identified regulators and various known network components will be organized into a putative signaling network, using numerous computational approaches. This network will be subsequently dissected and refined based on genomic, genetic, and biochemical studies. These experiments will help to elucidate the complex stress-activated signaling network in yeast, which serves as an excellent model for such networks in humans and other organisms, while developing computational approaches that are likely to advance this area of biology. As many of these responses are conserved in humans, these results will foster stress minimization and disease prevention in human medicine.  Project Relevance: Many stress-defense mechanisms used by yeast are conserved in humans, and therefore the results of this proposal will provide a strong foundation for understanding, and eventually modulating, stress resistance for human health. These results will have broad application, from minimizing debilitating side effects of chemotherapy, to reducing trauma inflicted by invasive surgery, heart attacks and strokes, to preventing cancer. Furthermore, understanding how yeast sense and respond to stress is an excellent model for how human cells respond to analogous cellular stresses.\n",

      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Liver diseases are among the 10 leading causes of death in the United States. The liver's extraordinary regenerative capacity is critical to understanding the mechanisms leading to developmental defects, acute and chronic liver diseases, and liver carcinogenesis. Stimulation of hepatocyte proliferation while preventing apoptosis is essential to the liver's regenerative process. Recently we uncovered a tumor suppressor pathway has potent effects upon liver cell division and death. Our long range goal is to define the cellular mechanisms underlying liver regeneration in health and disease and to apply these findings to developing improved therapies for liver disease. To that end, we are uniquely capable to address the objectives of this application, which are to uncover the mechanism that leads to the novel tumor suppressors' profound effects upon the liver. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that: The tumor suppressor controls liver celgrowth factor pathway in controlling liver size. At the end of the study we will better understand the growth and death of liver cells. This will help develop treatment for many liver diseases such as liver transplantation, cirrhosis, acute and chronic hepatitis.\n",

      "ABSTRACT  Influenza virus is a serious public health threat. Seasonal outbreaks cause significant morbidity and mortality, and  pandemic  outbreaks  have  the  potential  for  widespread  infection  and  disease.  Novel pandemic viruses emerge from animal reservoirs to rapidly become the dominant circulating strains, as was the case during the emergence of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic virus. Like all viruses, influenza virus is completely dependent upon the host cell for replication.  Influenza  virus  exploits  and  subverts  host  processes  while  at  the  same  time evading  cellular  antiviral  responses.  The  balance  between  these  pro-ÃÂ­  and  antiviral  forces  influences  the outcome of a viral infection, yet we have limited knowledge on the host factors engaged during replication and how they impact disease severity and the emergence of new viruses. This information is required to define the molecular mechanisms underpinning a productive infection. The overall goal of this proposal is to identify host factors and their mechanisms that regulate influenza virus replication. We have generated data on a genome-wide scale identifying new host factors that impact infection. We specifically focused on events that occur after influenza virus enters the host cell. Results from our genome-wide knockout screen reveal that a large class of proÃÂ­-apoptotic  and  innate  antiviral  factors,  including  IFIT2  and  IFIT3,  are  actually  important  enhancers  of influenza  virus  replication.  We  hypothesize  that  while  apoptosis  is  generally  seen  as  a  last-ÃÂ­resort  antiviral defense, influenza virus has evolved to exploit the apoptotic cellular environment for maximal viral replication. In  Aim  1,  we  will  determine  the  impact  of  IFIT2  and  IFIT3  on  infection  and  define  the  functions  of  IFIT2  and apoptosis that promote viral replication. In Aim 2, we will use a newly developed technique to perform a virally driven  selection  of  host  modulators  and  use  sophisticated  network  analysis  to  identify  key  players  and pathways at the virus:host interface. We will then use the experimental strategies optimized in Aim 1 to define the mechanisms of these newly identified viral regulators. Major strengths of our strategy are that it can identify both pro- and antiviral co-factors and it is not restricted to influenza virus, but can be quickly adapted to study virus:host  interactions  in  almost  any  viral  system.  The results from this proposal will establish a mechanistic understanding of viral and host factors regulating infection. This detailed knowledge is essential for defining the molecular events that underpin a successful infection and identifying new targets that can be exploited for the rational development of antiviral therapies.\n",

      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Baylies, Mary K. Development, Function and Repair of the Muscle Cell Project Summary: This application requests partial support to conduct the international meeting,  Development, Function and Repair of the Muscle Cell . This meeting is part of the  Frontiers in Myogenesis  series, which is sponsored by the Society for Muscle Biology. This conference series has been held triennially for more than 20 years. This specific meeting will be held June 4-8, 2012 on the campus of New York University at the Kimmel Center in Manhattan, New York. We expect approximately 350 participants from around the world. The  Development, Function and Repair of the Muscle Cell  conference is timely and significant for three reasons: 1) the studies of embryonic and adult myogenesis and muscle development and regeneration are seeing a rich convergence in genes and mechanisms. This conference will serve as a platform to highlight key similarities in these processes with a view tothe understanding of muscle disease; 2) the emerging areas in the regulation of muscle development include nuclear organization and chromatin remodeling during muscle specification and differentiation, RNA regulation, cell-cell fusion, muscle cell architecture including nuclear and mitochondrial positioning, muscle cell interactions with nerve and tendon cells, and muscle stem cell activation and use for repair. This meeting will focus and discuss these areas with leading experts from around the world; and (3) this meeting is placing a unique emphasis upon inviting key investigators on the cutting edge of cell biological research outside, but complementary, to the muscle field. The goal is to stimulate cross-disciplinary collaborations for the muscle field to address issues in the field that are emerging and promise to advance the field. The overall objective of this meeting is to bring together experts in developmental, cellula and molecular biology, adult muscle biology, human genetics and translational research significant for muscle disease to stimulate research and foster new collaborations at both the basic and translational levels. In addition, we will focus on recent advances in the regulatory mechanisms in muscle specification, muscle differentiation, muscle regeneration, muscle stem cell biology and emphasize how these advances inform potential therapies for muscle disease. Seven plenary sessions presenting 62 speakers (20 to be selected from submitted abstracts) at the senior, mid-career and junior levels will address: Origins, Patterning and Behaviors of Muscle Progenitors; Transcriptional Control of Myogenesis and Muscle Progenitors' Identity; Muscle Differentiation; Interaction of Muscle Cells with its Environment; Adult Muscle Progenitors, Satellite cells: Specification and Contribution to Muscle Repair; Muscle Size Regulation; and Therapeutic Interventions to Human Muscle Disease. Three dedicated poster sessions that feature these and related topics will be held. Significantly, the participants of thi conference represent interdisciplinary groups that will afford a comprehensive analysis and integration of recent discoveries in the field. In addition, the conference will promote cross-fertilization of ideas and collaborative interactions, particularly from scientists working on the leading edge of cell biology. We expect that the major advances in muscle development, muscle cell biology, gene regulation, muscle stem cells and regeneration and muscle disease that have taken place since the previous  Frontiers in Myogenesis  conference will make this upcoming meeting in New York an essential gathering for investigators across these areas of muscle biology.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Baylies, Mary K. Development, Function and Repair of the Muscle Cell Project Narrative This conference will provide a novel platform for the interaction of experts and trainees in genetics, molecular, cellular and developmental biology of muscle and in translational research significant to muscle disease. The meeting will place additional importance upon inviting key investigators on the cutting edge of cell biological research outside, but complementary, to the muscle field. The goal is to stimulate cross-disciplinary collaborations for the muscle field to address issues in the field that are emerging and promise to advance the field. The meeting will promote discussion and dissemination of recently published and unpublished data pertinent to the cellular and molecular regulation of muscle development and homeostasis in the embryo and the adult; how these processes go awry in muscle disease and how knowledge of normal muscle formation and homeostasis may be exploited in muscle disease therapies.\n",

      "This proposal aims to improve the retention of graduate students in the first two years and increase the number of students going to graduate school.  We do this by incorporating students in research and the mathematical community earlier and providing support programs for pre-graduate students. The main component is a set of interconnected summer programs involving research experiences and short courses for students.  These are designed to engage them and encourage them to continue in mathematics. Several parts of this proposal are directly aimed at underrepresented students. The major programs include the following. (1) Research for Early Graduate Students (REG), designed to sustain the enthusiasm for collaborative original research that attracts students to Ph.D. programs by providing them with research experiences during the early years of graduate work. (2) Research and enrichment experiences for under-represented undergraduate students (REU+), designed to provide a supportive REU experience for underrepresented students who may not usually consider an REU program. An important feature is the inclusion of established mentors of underrepresented students to work with the program and us. (3) Enhanced Research Program for Early Graduates (REG+), a one-year program for students who have graduated from college and are not quite prepared for graduate studies in mathematics. This program targets underrepresented groups. The program includes a summer research experience, a year of remedial course work and significant mentoring.  Four important groups are included: underrepresented undergraduate students, post-baccalaureate students considering returning to mathematics, under-prepared graduate students, and early graduate students. In particular, this grant features a collaborative effort between faculty at NCSU, and the Mathematics Departments of 6 Historically Black Colleges and Universities. We aim to increase the number of underrepresented students who get graduate degrees in Mathematics.\n",

      "PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions): Clinical Trials Office The Clinical Trials Office (CTO) provides a centralized service to support the development and execution of clinical trials in all of the Center's defined Research Programs. The CTO oversees all trials from a variety of venues and sponsors, including pharmaceutical, local institutional trials, and cooperative group trials. It has oversight of trials from a diverse group of medical specialties including, but not limited to, medical oncology, radiation oncology, surgery, hematology oncology, gynecologic oncology, palliative care, supportive care, and basic science. This includes protocol preparation, data acquisition, safety monitoring and reporting, quality assurance, regulatory compliance, overall study management and personnel training. The CTO serves the overall clinical research needs of investigators in protocol development and activation, and its staff is integral to the clinical care provided throughout the clinical trial continuum. The CTO is intentionally structured to operate with efficiency, to focus on the quality of clinical data collected, and to facilitate timely activation of and accrual to therapeutic trials. Sustained success has been demonstrated in all 3 categories. Targeted efforts are ongoing in order to reduce the number of low accruing clinical trials and to increase the number of investigator-initiated therapeutic clinical trials and accrual to those trials. Since the last review, considerable efforts have been made to centralize clinical and protocol data management activities by integrating the hematologic malignancies within the clinical trials office. The clinical trials office is currently implementing a new clinical trial management system (Velos) in collaboration with the Clinical Translational Research Institute (CTRI) (the CTRI leverages CTSA grant support), which will provide more robust protocol management and patient accrual reporting capabilities. Additionally, a protocol development manager and regulatory specialist have been recruited to assist with the conduct of the center's investigator-initiated trials. An important focus for new trials will be molecular profiling and individualization of therapy, which will be implemented within clinical trials with CTO staff support.\n",

      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Abuse of cocaine is a widespread and severely deleterious public health problem. Although it is well established that there is substantial variability in an individual's response to cocaine exposure, we do not yet understand the mechanisms that mediate individual differences in the etiology of cocaine abuse and addiction. In particular, we do not understand why some individuals are resistant to the effects of cocaine and will consume cocaine at low rates whereas other individuals are relatively vulnerable to the effects of cocaine and will consume cocaine at high rates. In the present proposal, we will evaluate several novel biomarkers that may predict the vulnerability of an individual to abuse cocaine or to relapse following abstinence. We will evaluate these processes using drug self-administration (SA) and reinstatement of previously drug-maintained behavior in nonhuman primates, as these are well established animal models of cocaine abuse and relapse. Moreover, we propose to determine, in a highly systematic manner, whether the availability of specific brain proteins, the acute brain activational effects of cocaine, or the integrity of functional bran networks predicts cocaine abuse and relapse. We believe that these studies will have important public health implications because these techniques can be translated into use in human subjects, and they will allow physicians to individually tailor treatment plans based on the current status of the cocaine-dependent patient.\n",

      "The goal of the laboratory is to develop new approaches to the study of the genetic basis of cancer and its outcomes. Previously, the major focus was the analysis of common genetic variation in candidate genes in cancer and its related outcomes, particularly in immunocompromised individuals. Emphasis was on conducting pilot association studies and annotating candidate genes drawn from key pathways in innate immunity and cancer biology, such as telomere stability or nutrient transport (i.e., Vitamin C sodium dependent transport). The laboratory has developed expertise in bio-informatics and advanced genetic analyses with new platforms designed to test dense sets of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), which are the most common genetic variants in the human genome. Specifically, the laboratory has integrated approaches to identify and validate common SNPs and ancestral haplotypes, which could be used to dissect the genetic basis of disease susceptibility.  The laboratory utilizes programs and approaches in population genetics, epidemiology and molecular evolution, which assist in the choice and analysis of genetic variants under study. The same strategy has also been extended to pilot studies in solid tumors, such as osteogenic sarcoma, colorectal and prostate cancer. In addition, the laboratory has initiated study of the genetic events underlying development of Ewings Sarcoma. A population genetics approach has been employed to examine the possible contribution of genomic variation in the EWSR1 region and also to look at genetic variants on distant chromosomes that could increase or decrease risk for Ewings Sarcoma.  Recently, the focus of the laboratory has shifted to dissect the genetic basis of SNP markers validated in large scale, genome-wide association studies (GWAS). This new approach can identify new regions to be studied in great detail and eventually applied to large molecular epidemiology studies to estimate the magnitude of the effect. It will also be possible to investigate the interaction between genes and environmental factors. Moreover, these markers may identify potential genotypic differences that could bear important predictive value for disease as well as highlight potential pathways related to both disease etiology and perhaps therapeutic intervention. We have developed a series of collaborations with leading epidemiologists and bio-statisticians in the Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG). Collaborative efforts have resulted in the development of new approaches to assess the false positive report probability (FPRP), a new tool intended to better assess the robustness of findings in genetic association studies. Lastly, the long-term goals of the laboratory are to identify and characterize genetic variants that could be used as prospective tools for early detection and intervention. the studies currently underway are directed at elucidating the biological basis of the susceptibility of risk alleles. At the same time, the current strategy continues to highlight genetic variants in key pathways in cancer susceptibility and outcome.  In addition, the laboratory is closely related to the NCI Core Genotyping Facility of the NCI. The availability of high throughput sequence and genotype expertise is critical for conducting pilot studies as well as sufficiently powered, well-designed studies in molecular epidemiology and pharmacogenomics. Adaptation and integration of new informatic tools, such as Genewindow and ht-SNP selection have also been implemented.  The laboratory has focused on a series of follow-up steps based on the results of the Cancer Genetic Markers of Susceptibility genome wide association studies of prostate and breast cancer. After extensive replication studies established strong statistical significance, the laboratory has begun to study the new loci, mapping the common and uncommon genetic variants in order to nominate suitable variants for functional studies, designed to provide plausibility to strong association signals. The laboratory will conduct a series of genetic analyses designed to dissect the genetic variants associated with disease risk also discovered in GWAS of other cancers, such pancreatic, bladder and lung cancers. These studies will include deep re-sequencing to develop a comprehensive catalogue of variants necessary to generate detailed haplotypes for subsequent genotyping large case controls. In turn, functional studies will be conducted to investigate the biological basis of the contribution of genetic variants to disease susceptibility. Collaboration with other laboratories will be sought to investigate the association between germ-line genetic variants and somatic changes in related tumor tissue.\n",

      "Description (provided by applicant): The Mechanisms of Cell Signaling Research Core is focused on the mechanisms of signaling by which cells recognize and respond to environmental stresses that influence cell proliferation and survival. Clearly many environmental agents alter key signaling pathways, thus provoking aberrations in the molecular signaling mechanisms that stimulate or suppress cell proliferation or apoptosis. These alterations include activation of oncoproteins, inactivation of tumor suppressors, and modification of apoptotic signaling pathways. Together with genetics, signal transduction has contributed significantly to the current molecular and mechanistic understanding of disorders of cell proliferation and apoptosis, such as cancer and neurodegenerative diseases, that are frequently linked to environmental exposures. Due to the recent explosion in genomic- and proteomic-based research, the Center in Molecular Toxicology has developed a new research core, Mechanisms of Cell Signaling, comprised of investigators with a breadth of research experience and interests that focus on dissecting cellular signaling pathways relevant to toxicology. Members of this Core provide the Center with faculty committed to determining key signaling pathways and analyzing proteins in those pathways that play pivotal roles in cellular outcome. The Core provides considerable expertise upon which other Cores in the Center can develop new understandings and approaches for the analysis of particular signaling pathways. Core membership represents diverse interests within the area of cell signaling. The members include faculty with interests in chemistry and biochemistry, as well as cellular and molecular biology. However, the Core maintains a primary overall focus, analysis of biochemical mechanisms that impact signaling pathways that dictate cell proliferation, DNA repair, and cell survival. The Core has two broad goals: 1) to increase the awareness of research objectives within each laboratory, thereby encouraging collaborative possibilities within the Core and Center, and 2) to provide strongbiological expertise for addressing the biological relevance and regulation of other biochemicalprocesses that are the focus of other Research Cores within the Center.\n",

      "--------------------\n",
      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Studies are proposed to advance understanding of the organization of human memory and the nature of memory disorders. The work involves six studies, which are organized around three topics that have been prominent in recent discussions of memory and memory impairment: A) Recent memory and remote memory; B) Recognition memory and the human hippocampus; C) Working memory and the medial temporal lobe. A salient aspect of the proposed work is the opportunity to continue study of our population of memory-impaired patients with bilateral lesions limited to the hippocampus or with larger medial temporal lobe lesions. Many of these patients are veterans. Our population of amnesic study patients, including the veterans, is one of the very few such populations available anywhere and is the best characterized in terms of detailed, quantitative neuroanatomy. A second and complementary aspect of the proposed work is neuroimaging studies of learning and memory in healthy individuals using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The following six studies are proposed: A) Recent memory and remote memory (an fMRI study of healthy volunteers). This is a prospective study of recent and remote memory, testing memory in the scanner for material that was learned 1 hr to 1 month earlier. We will also determine how brain activity in response to the new items that are presented during scanning is related to how novel these items are judged to be during scanning and how well these items are remembered in a later memory test. In this way, we will assess brain activity both as it relates to the age of a memory (1hr to 1 month) and also as it relates to the formation of new memories. Ba) Recognition memory and source memory (an fMRI study of healthy volunteers). We will use an improved and novel design asking whether activity in the hippocampus and perirhinal cortex during learning is differentially predictive of subsequent recognition memory and the subsequent ability to remember the context in which material was learned. This study addresses a fundamental issue: how sharp is the division of labor within medial temporal lobe structures? Bb) Remember (R) and Know (K) responses after hippocampal damage. We will ask whether the hippocampus selectively supports recollection (i.e., memory for the context in which learning occurred), or whether the hippocampus has a broader role in memory that includes the ability to detect simple familiarity. Bc) Recognition memory for faces. We will ask whether the capacity for face learning and face recognition is organized differently than the capacity to learn and recognize other kinds of material (e.g., specifically words and scenes). Is face memory hippocampus-dependent? Ca) Working memory for object-place associations. We will use a novel change-detection task to determine the working memory capacity for object-place associations and will ask whether working memory for this domain of material is independent of the medial temporal lobe. Cb) Relational working memory at short lag times. We will ask whether working memory is intact or impaired after medial temporal lobe damage as measured by tasks that assess relational memory for locations within complex scenes. These two studies (Ca and Cb) reassess the classical distinction between short-term and long-term memory. The issue hinges on the difficulty in determining which process (short-term memory or long-term memory) is supporting task performance in any particular case. I have devised a method that can make this determination.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     The proposed work aims to understand the organization and function of the brain systems that support human memory and to illuminate the nature of memory disorders. Memory problems are commonly reported in conjunction with neurological and psychiatric illness and are a significant issue in veterans' health. Improved knowledge about how memory works, and about how memory fails after injury or disease, lays a foundation for the development of technology and interventions to help diagnose, treat, and prevent the diseases that affect memory, including Alzheimer's disease. Better knowledge about how memory works, and sometimes does not work, also provides a foundation for the assessment and treatment of age-related memory impairment, which is increasingly significant in our aging population and in aging veterans.\n",

The outcome of this project will be a CMOS device that is scalable and reduce off-state leakage as well as minimize threshold voltage variation.  This project will develop a process technology that is compatible with high volume manufacturing using industrial toolsets.  The main objective for the phase 1 of the proposed SBIR project is to demonstrate prototype UT-FET devices using manufacturing-capable tools and processes.  The UT-FET device architecture involves a novel means of isolation of the device that can reduce cost, reduce leakage and increase speed of electronics systems.  In this phase 1 of the SBIR project, production capable tools and processes will be used to demonstrate scalability of the technology for volume manufacturing. Successful completion of this technology demonstration can allow insertion of this technology into the growing markets for low power mobile communications electronics.The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be address and overcome  the current limits to scaling in low power electronic devices. Low  power electronics devices use CMOS technologies and the scaling of these devices have been the driving force behind the communication revolution over the last two decades. Further scaling of these devices will enable faster communication, longer battery life and more energy efficient operation of electronics systems. Additionally in the process of developing and demonstrating this technology new scientific and technological understanding of using thin crystalline devices and the tools to manufacture them in high volume will enable other applications in energy, RF signal processing and power management.\n",

      "--------------------\n",
      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Heart disease caused by the loss or dysfunction of cardiomyocytes is the leading cause of death worldwide. The adult mammalian heart possesses little regenerative potential and therefore displays fatal loss of function following myocardial infarction (MI) and other heart diseases. Fibrosis and scar formation due to activation of cardiac fibroblasts serve as barriers to cardiac regeneration and contribute to loss of contractile function, pathological remodeling and susceptibility to arrhythmias. Recently, combinations of cardiogenic transcription factors were shown to be capable of activating cardiac gene expression in fibroblasts in vitro. Moreover, we have shown that forced expression of four transcription factors in cardiac fibroblasts is sufficient to activate cardiac gene expression in vivo, leading to improvement of cardiac function and reduction of adverse ventricular remodeling following MI in mice. Although these reprogramming processes are not yet optimized, they hold great potential for eventual cardiac repair, avoiding many of the obstacles associated with cellular transplantation. The overall goals of this project are to further define the mechanisms involved in reprogramming of cardiac cell fate and to optimize the technology for reprogramming of fibroblasts to cardiomyocytes in vivo as a strategy for cardiac repair. We will also assess the ability of selected small molecules and microRNAs to enhance cardiac reprogramming in vivo as a strategy for restoration of cardiac function following MI. These studies will provide important new insights into the mechanisms of cardiac cell fate specification and differentiation and will pave the way toward innovative approaches for cardiac repair.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Ischemic heart disease resulting in myocardial infarction (MI) and heart failure is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States. Recent studies have suggested a new approach for restoration of cardiac function following MI, through conversion of cardiac fibroblasts into cardiomyocytes by the introduction of defined cardiac transcription factors. In this project, this approach will be optimized using combinations of cardiogenic transcription factors, small molecules and microRNAs and the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying cardiac reprogramming in vitro and in vivo will be defined.\n",

      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Asthma, a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways, is estimated by the World Health Organization to affect 150 million people worldwide and its global pharmacotherapeutic costs exceed $5 billion per year. Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC) provides clinical care to -7000 asthmatic children in the primary care and specialty clinics. Last year, over 3000 children were treated in the CCHMC Emergency Department with the primary diagnosis of an acute asthma exacerbation, and 885 patients (29.5%) were admitted to the hospital for management of acute asthma exacerbations. CCHMC has invested considerable resources to promote asthma research including the establishment of the Division of Asthma Research, which has partnered with the Asthma Center to create a comprehensive Asthma Program, which now provides a central base for the clinical and research activities for asthma at CCHMC. Patients suffering from asthma share similar clinical symptoms, but the disease is heterogenous in terms of phenotypes and natural history 3, 4. This heterogeneity contributes to the difficulty in both studying and treating asthma. The heterogeneity in asthma is poorly understood and the mechanisms by which genetic and environmental influences impact asthma development and asthma disease expression are largely unknown. As such, the proposed Asthma Research Core has the central goal of improving the understanding of the heterogeneity in asthma. In order to accomplish this goal, we propose 2 aims: Aim #1: To recruit or promote a new faculty member into the tenure track to develop a research program focused a topic relevant to elucidating the mechanisms contributing to asthma heterogeneity. Aim #2: To develop a pilot research program in Asthma Research to support new faculty in the tenure track in the areas outlined above.    The frequency of absent or incomplete efficacy in asthma treatment is as high as 70%, due to the inherent heterogeneity in asthma phenotypes caused by multiple genetic and environmental influences. The central goal of this proposal is to improve the understanding of the heterogeneity in asthma. Improved understanding of asthma phenotypes will enable informed personalized treatment plans and likely will result in substantial reduction in asthma expenditures.\n",

      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): My goal for the K25 award is to establish myself as an independent neuroimaging researcher with expertise in brain network analysis and an integral member of multidisciplinary research teams devoted to addressing diseases of the brain. Attaining these objectives will require focused didactic training and research guidance. Research We will develop new methodology to improve whole-brain connectivity analyses of normal and abnormal brain function. The launching of the Human Connectome Project by the NIH in 2009 underscores the importance of whole-brain connectivity analyses. Appropriately conducting these analyses is paramount in our understanding normal brain function as well as alterations due to conditions such as aging, dyslexia, and substance abuse. Before we can glean useful information from functional brain network differences in these conditions, methods need to be developed in order to permit 1) assessing several network properties simultaneously while also accounting for the complex dependence structure of the networks; 2) making predictions about the presence and strength (weight) of connections between brain regions based on disease status; 3) determining whether task related changes in brain networks are associated with clinical outcomes. The novel methods proposed here will address these needs, providing more appropriate techniques for the emerging area of whole-brain connectivity analysis. This research, along with my proposed training experiences and strong mentoring team, will facilitate my progression toward becoming an independent neuroimaging researcher with expertise in brain network analysis and enable me to make unique contributions to brain research. Training The proposed training plan consists of four elements: 1) a didactic component aimed at establishing a basic foundation in computational neuroscience and image analysis; 2) career guidance in methodological development and collaborative neuroimaging research through planned on and off-site mentoring by neuroscientists and network and neuroimaging statisticians; 3) conducting innovative research utilizing the gained neuroscientific and image analytic knowledge and previous statistical training; and 4) participating in the exchange of ideas in statistics and the neurosciences through conference and workshop attendance. The planned training activities will focus on deepening my understanding of the brain as a complex system, enabling me to reasonably model and evaluate this system within its biological context. The combination of my knowledge in network-based brain imaging statistics, computational neuroscience, and image analysis will be a valuable asset that will not be confined to a single brain disorder. While the data analyses proposed here will focus on aging and brain degeneration, dyslexia, and substance abuse, the skills and knowledge that I will gain will position me to collaborate with investigators that study a broad range of clinical brain disorders.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: My goal for the K25 award is to establish myself as an independent neuroimaging researcher with expertise in brain network analysis and an integral member of multidisciplinary research teams devoted to addressing diseases of the brain. The training activities will focus on deepening my understanding of the brain as a complex system, enabling me to reasonably model and evaluate this system in a biologically meaningful way. The research activities will focus on developing new methodology and modifying existing methods in order to improve whole-brain connectivity analyses of normal and abnormal brain function.\n",

      "The IL-2 receptor and related cytokine receptor systems are being studied to clarify the T cell immune response in normal, neoplastic, and immunodeficient states. Following T-cell activation by antigen, the magnitude and duration of the T-cell immune response is determined by the amount of IL-2 produced, levels of receptors expressed, and time course of each event. The IL-2 receptor contains three chains, IL-2Ra, IL-2Rb, and gc. Dr. Leonard cloned IL-2Ra in 1984, we discovered IL-2Rb in 1986, and reported in 1993 that mutation of the gc chain results in X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (XSCID, which has a T-B+NK- phenotype) in humans. We reported in 1995 that mutations of the gc-associated kinase, JAK3, result in an autosomal recessive form of SCID indistinguishable from XSCID and in 1998 that T-B+NK+ SCID results from mutations in the IL7R gene. Based on work in our lab and others, gc was previously shown to be shared by the receptors for IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, IL-15, and IL-21. We also previously characterized genes that were induced or repressed by IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, and IL-15, including showing the negative regulation of the IL-7 receptor alpha chain, a finding with implications in understanding how IL-2 can promote cell death, and the positive regulation of a dual specificity phosphatase, DUSP5, that negatively regulates IL-2-mediated activation of ERK kinases. T helper cell differentiation is critical for normal immune responses, with Th1 differentiation being important for host defense to viruses and other intracelllular pathogens, Th2 differentiation being vital in allergic disorders and related to helminths, and Th17 differentiation being vital in a range of inflammatory disorders, including psoriasis and inflammatory bowel disease. We previously showed that IL-2 is important for Th2 differentiation and reported that IL-2 regulates expression of the IL-4 receptor in a STAT5-dependent manner and critically controls priming of cells for Th2 differentiation. Moreover, using genome-wide Illumina-based ChIP-Seq (chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled to DNA sequencing) analysis, we had discovered broad regulation of Th2 differentiation via STAT5A and STAT5B, substantially extending earlier studies focused on STAT5A. Moreover, we had discovered that IL-2-mediated IL-4Ra induction was critical in priming cells for Th2 differentiation. In the prior year, we substantially extended these findings by showing that IL-2 via STAT5 induces expression of IL-12Rb1 and IL-12Rb2 and that the induction of IL-12Rb2 is critical for Th1 differentiation and we defined the mechanism of regulation of IL-12Rb2. Additionally, we showed that IL-2 via STAT5 also regulates the T box protein, T-bet. Interestingly, in contrast to the induction of IL-12R proteins, IL-2 inhibits expression of IL-6Ra and gp130, helping to explain the inhibition of Th17 differentiation. Consistent with the ability of Tbx21 to inhibit Th17 differentiation, expression of Tbx21 in Th17 cells resulted in increased IFNg but decreased expression of IL-17A. These results indicated a very broad effect of IL-2 via STAT5 on T helper cell differentiation.In the current review year, we have continued to study the role of IL-2 in Th differentiation, extending findings to Th9 differentiation. We also have continued our studies of the role of STAT5 tetramerization in vivo, with our initial report having been in the prior year.During the past year, we collaborated with Dr. K. Christopher Garcia at Stanford, studying the actions of wild type IL-2 versus novel IL-2 variants, a project with potential clinical ramifications. These studies in part use the pmel-1 T cell receptor transgenic model of adoptive immunotherapy for cancer in collaboration with Dr. Nicholas Restifo, NCI. We also collaborated with Dr. Garcia on a project in which the three dimensional structure of IL-2 complexed to its receptor was compared to that of IL-15 bound to its receptor. These studies, reported in the past year, have provided key mechanistic and structural insights into the functional differences between IL-2 and IL-15, which are highly related and share IL-2Rbeta and gc as receptor components but nevertheless possess distinctive biological functions. Although IL-2 primarily signals via cis-signaling and IL-15 via trans-signaling, these cytokines have essentially identical activation of STAT, PI3K/Akt, and Ras/MAPK signaling pathways. Moreover, gene expression profiles are very similar, although not identical. Thus, these cytokines have almost indistinguishable signaling properties despite different biological responses. This study has substantially elucidated structural and mechanistic aspects of IL-2 and IL-15 signaling. We previously reported the generation of IL-2/IL-21 dual reporter BAC transgenic mice. These mice allow one to observed through surrogate fluorescent markers the relative induction of these cytokines in different cells. Using these mice, we previously demonstrated a key role for IL-21 in a model mouse system for experimental autoimmune uveitis, and we had demonstrated the existence of IL-2, IL-21, and IL-2/IL-21 double expressing cells in the retina, consistent with a role for this cytokine in the disease process. We are continuing to develop studies with these valuable animals, with the intent of learning more about the roles of IL-2 and IL-21 in vivo.We also have the long-term goal of identifying new causes of human immunodeficiency and other hematological diseases.Overall, these studies help to improve our understanding of signaling by gc family cytokines. These findings clarify basic molecular mechanisms that are relevant to normal and pathological immune cell function, including allergy, autoimmunity, and cancer.\n",

      "Ã¯Â»Â¿   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to explore the possibility of using fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) to study traumatic brain injury (TBI). This research is important because TBI is a major health problem. TBI occurs with high incidence, annually affecting about 1 in 500 people in the U.S., and it is associated with lifelong debilitating physical, cognitive, behavioral, and emotional outcomes. This research is also important because there are no therapies currently available to improve TBI outcomes. Since 1985, at least 21 clinical trials have been conducted, and none have shown a significant benefit in TBI outcomes. The failure to develop therapies is likely due to the complexity of TBI, both in terms of the severity and spatial distribution of injury to the brain and the elaborate responses of the brain to injury. Therefore, there is a need for new experimental models that can help us understand the main cellular and molecular mechanisms that underlie TBI outcomes, with the potential for identifying novel targets for diagnostic and therapeutic intervention. Our fly TBI model is significant because (1) it uses a mechanical force to inflict brain injury, similar to mechanisms that commonly occur in humans, (2) it generates a continuum of injury severity that predicts outcome severity, (3) it generates injury in a reproducible manner, making it possible to determine the contribution of genetic and environmental variables to outcomes, (4) it produces injury outcomes that mimic clinically relevant outcomes of TBI in humans, (5) it uses standardized experimental protocols that are affordable, simple, and widely applicable, and (6) it is supported by the unparalleled knowledge of the fly nervous system and experimental tools that are available for flies. To achieve the goal of determining the extent of similarity between fly and human TBI, we propose to identify genes and secondary events associated with death following TBI.\n",

      "Since 1995, over 40 countries have adopted legislation that mandates women's participation in government, and these policies enjoy considerable support from international organizations, politicians, and activists.  Practitioners who seek to increase women's presence in office do so in large part because they believe it will provide normative benefits for women through improved policy representation.  Despite this widely held assumption, it is clear that in a number of cases increasing women's representation fails to transform the legislative agenda.  While in some countries women's increased participation alters policy representation-defined in this project as the adoption of legislation related to women's interests-in others the addition of female legislators has had only limited consequences.Why does increasing women's participation lead to such mixed results?  This project represents one of the first systematic efforts to carefully develop and test theoretical expectations concerning when and why increasing women's presence in national assemblies leads to greater attention to women's issues.  A series of empirical implications are developed that can be used to assess the correlations (or lack thereof) that are often found between women's presence in legislative assemblies and instance of women's policy representation.  These observable implications are used to establish when increases in women's presence in office cause policy adoption. The research design combines a cross-national statistical analysis on the adoption of legislation related to women's issues with a qualitative case study of women's representation in the Labour Party of Great Britain.Given the attention and resources that have been dedicated to increasing the number of women in national assemblies, elucidating the relationship between women's presence in office and legislative attention to women's issues is a timely project with obvious policy implications.  By illustrating that not all institutional settings facilitate the link between women's participation and representation, it helps to explain instances where female legislators fail to transform the legislative agenda.  For policy actors committed to increasing attention to women's issues, the theoretical framework also provides criteria for identifying cases in which women's greater participation may secure their policy representation.  Thus, in challenging the presumed link between the presence of female representation and attention to women's interests, the project provides a more nuanced interpretation as to whether increasing the number of women in office  matters  for legislative outcomes.\n",

      "PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions): This is an application for renewal of the George M. O'Brien Kidney Center at Yale. This center was established with the overarching goal to facilitate basic, translational and clinical research that will advance the prevention and treatment of kidney diseases. Major research areas of emphasis are renal epithelial cell biology and physiology; inherited kidney disease and kidney development; acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD); and vascular biology, inflammation and glomerular disease. A critically important benefit of the Center is to provide renal investigators both at Yale and across the country with access to highly specialized services not otherwise routinely available to support their research. To this end, the Center includes three cores to provide small animal physiology and phenotyping services to enable detailed characterization of renal function at the level of the tubule, the kidney, and the intact organism in normal animals and in animal models of renal injury and kidney disease; provide mouse genetics and cell line services to develop novel animal models and kidney cell lines to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying normal renal function and the pathophysiology of kidney diseases; and provide human genetics and clinical research services to enhance the ability of renal investigators to apply advanced genetic and genomic technologies to human investigation. Our cores currently have a combined user base of approximately 90 investigators, including over 40 at outside institutions. A Pilot and Feasibility Program has the goals of providing initial project funding for young investigators, attracting new investigators into the field of kidney disease research, and fostering translational and clinical studies directly related to kidney diseases. In addition, an Enrichment Program enhances kidney disease research by maximizing interaction and information sharing among renal investigators and trainees, and by providing activities to enhance recruitment and education of all levels of trainees from undergraduate students to postdoctoral fellows.\n",

      "Ã¯Â»Â¿   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Protein synthesis is an essential metabolic process in all bacteria and a target for the development of new antibiotics. In our initially funded SCORE grant we developed an amino acylation/translation (A/T) system from P. aeruginosa based on polyU mRNA directed protein synthesis. This system was optimized and developed into a platform to perform high throughput screening of chemical compounds against the activity of the system. During this period a number of inhibitory compounds (six) were identified and characterized and developed into lead compounds. A small (5-6) congener group was built around six of the lead compounds. The goal of the current proposal is to develop a lead series around each of these lead compounds as well as to continue discovery of additional compounds that inhibit growth of pathogenic bacteria. To develop a lead series we will carry out structure activity relationship (SAR) studies to increase the inhibitory potency, solubility, ADME and abilit to inhibit biofilm formation. At the same time we will attempt to decrease the potential for drug-drug induced enzyme inhibition and toxicity to human cell lines. In the continued discovery process, we will actively recruit collaborators doing work in isolation of natural compounds to test against our system for identification of new inhibitory compounds as well as obtain small focused synthetic compound libraries. The IC50 as well as the MIC against a panel of pathogenic bacteria will initially be determined for each new inhibitor discovered. These data willdetermine if new hit compounds enter SAR studies as described above.  Next, we propose to expand the A/T minimal protein synthesis system into a more natural like protein synthesis system. During the initial grant period, we were able to accomplish much more than was proposed. We have cloned, expressed, and isolated 11 additional proteins involved in protein synthesis: seven additional aaRS proteins, three translation initiation factors (IF-1, IF-2, and IF3) and the methionyl-tRNA formyltransferase. Incorporation of these proteins into the A/T assay, along with a designer natural like mRNA, allowing translation of a short peptide will allow us to screen for inhibitors of the ribosome and 15 accessory proteins in one assay. We have functional assays developed for each component of the system and will be able to quickly determine the molecular target of an inhibitor. This system will be developed and optimized based on the experience gained in the initial funding period. Screening of compound libraries will continue to be carried out in a high throughput format using scintillation proximity assays (SPA).  Four of the lead compounds inhibit protein synthesis by inhibiting the activity of PheRS. To determine mechanism of action of these inhibitory compounds we will evaluate promising lead compounds for their ability to generate spontaneous mutants or develop resistant after serial sub-culturing of hypersensitive strains of P. aeruginosa. We will screen for mutations in the gene encoding PheRS. The structure for P. aeruginosa PheRS has been solved and we will collaborate with Dr. Kotsikorou at UTPA and use the crystal structure and molecular modeling methods to explain the effects of the mutations on resistance to the antibacterial compounds. We will also model the binding of the compounds in the active site of PheRS to better understand the mechanism of inhibitory activity.\n",

      "visual retinal vision eye retina glaucoma degeneration amd photoreceptor ocular\n",
      "--------------------\n",
      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This research aims at understanding how visual information is processed in the eye and brain. Vision begins in the retina, a complex network of neurons in the back of the eye where visual images are converted into streams of action potentials that travel through the fibers of the optic nerve to the brain. There the signals pass through the thalamus to the visual cortex, where much larger circuits of neurons are brought to bear. Recent research has changed our view of the retina: Whereas it used to be considered a simple prefilter for the visual image, new results suggest that the retina computes quite specific features of the scene and conveys those to the brain through many parallel channels. The proposed research will build on this work, both to further our understanding of how the retina converts images into spike trains, and to investigate how this code for visual scenes can be used by the brain for further processing. This will be addressed in a collaborative project that combines experimental as well as theoretical and computational approaches. The specific aims are: (1) to unify diverse functions of the retina under a common mathematical formalism, and use this to discover new functions; (2) to determine how our brain might process retinal signals for rapid understanding of a new scene; (3) to explain how our fine vision can be so acute, given that the eyes are never holding still.  If successful, this research will offer benefits on multiple fronts. First, it will expand our notions of what a neural circuit like the retina can compute and how the information is encoded in its output, an important goal of systems neuroscience. Second, it will help resolve two mysteries of visual processing, relating to both its remarkable speed and its high acuity. Third, progress in these areas will benefit brain science in general. Many of the circuit motifs encountered in the retina are repeated in other brain areas, and may well serve similar network-level functions. Finally, an improved understanding of early visual function can change how one thinks about visual diseases and therapy. For example, it now appears that certain functions previously assigned to the visual cortex already happen in the retina; if so, then retinal dysfunction could also have much more elaborate effects on visual experience. Conversely, in efforts to treat retinal degeneration by electronic or genetic prostheses one needs to know which aspects of retinal function the prosthesis should emulate to support visual perception.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project concerns basic research into the function of the early visual system, from the eye to the visual cortex. It will lead to a better understanding of how we see, specifically which parts of vision are handled by the eye versus the brain. This in turn may improve methods of diagnosis for visual dysfunction. Such an understanding will also aid in the development of visual prostheses designed to replace a degenerated retina.\n",

      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A significant challenge for the development of new influenza vaccines is to identify strategies that can both accelerate vaccine production and protect against the emergence of epidemic and pandemic strains. This proposal will develop a DNA vaccine to meet these needs. DNA vaccines can be rapidly designed and manufactured to express multiple antigens and induce antibody and cell-mediated protection against distant drift variants. This proposal will employ particle-mediated epidermal delivery (PMED) of the DNA vaccine and builds on the recent success of a seasonal influenza PMED DNA vaccine that induced protective levels of antibody in vaccinated subjects in a phase I human clinical trial. The purpose of this proposal is to increase PMED DNA vaccine immunogenicity and further develop the vaccine as a pandemic flu product. The primary objectives of the proposal are to: 1) Broaden the specificity of the vaccine against genetically drifted strains and avian influenza by including multiple HA sequences. 2) Investigate the effects of including a nucleoprotein (NP) gene in the multivalent DNA vaccine with sequences modified and optimized to increase the breadth and potency of CD8+ T cell responses against highly conserved regions of the gene. 3) Determine if a novel genetic adjuvant that we have shown enhances antibody and cellular immune responses against other DNA vaccine antigens will similarly increase the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of the candidate pandemic influenza DNA vaccine. The vaccine will be tested for immunogenicity in the highly relevant ferret and nonhuman primate preclinical models. A model in rhesus macaques will be developed to take advantage of the information available on the Class I locus of this species required for analysis of T cell immunity. Aerosolized influenza challenges will be employed so that protective efficacy against homologous and drifted strains of avian influenza can be evaluated in a setting that mimics natural exposure in the population. These efforts will generate three candidate DNA vaccine products that induce antibody and cellular immune responses for protection against both seasonal and pandemic strains of influenza. These experiments will also test the hypothesis that vaccine induction of CD8+ T cell responses against conserved regions of the virus will increase protective efficacy against HA-drift variants and provide critical protection against mortality caused by emerging pandemic strains of influenza viruses.\n",

      "hearing speech auditory language cochlear processing loss noise perception sound\n",
      "--------------------\n",
      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent studies have shown that children with hearing loss who are identified through universal newborn hearing screening programs are not as delayed in speech and language development as children who are identified at later ages. It appears, however, that even with early identification and intervention (including amplification), these children are still delayed relative to children with normal hearing. In the current proposal, it is hypothesized that these persistent delays are the result of reduced auditory access and limited auditory experiences. Specifically, one consequence of congenital hearing loss is limited auditory access to speech. Reduced auditory experience in infancy may compromise auditory perceptual foundations upon which later language stages are constructed. It is critical to determine the constellation of auditory factors that support early learning and the experiences that facilitate continued language development throughout childhood. The overall goal of this project is to explore ways in which to enhance auditory access and auditory experiences in young children with hearing loss. Current hearing instruments and other assistive listening devices appear to be incapable of fully compensating for the perceptual degradation of hearing loss. In addition the negative influence of factors such as distance, noise, and reverberation are magnified for children with hearing loss, thus reducing the number and quality of auditory experiences. Two areas associated with reduced auditory access for children with hearing loss will be investigated in the studies described in this proposal. First, the influence of selected forms of advanced signal processing on speech perception, speech production, novel-word learning, and ease of listening will be explored. Second, experiments will be conducted to determine whether the quality and quantity of auditory experiences can be enhanced for the purpose of accelerating auditory skill development and adaptation to new signal-processing algorithms. In combination, these studies potentially could result in the development of alternative intervention strategies leading to more successful speech and language outcomes for children with hearing loss.\n",

      "tb tuberculosis mtb infection mdr mycobacterium resistant xdr infected africa\n",
      "--------------------\n",
      "Background: Almost 2 billion individuals are infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB). The human cost of TB is enormous. Despite the fact that excellent treatment is available, at least 1.4 million deaths annually are due to TB, and it is the world's leading cause of death from infectious disease. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that >40% of the 10.7 million individuals who fell ill with active TB in 2015 were not diagnosed by their countryÃ¢ÂÂs healthcare system. WHO stakeholder analysis stated that the most urgent need is for an accurate, rapid, biomarker-based non-sputum TB triage test that uses a readily accessible sample (e.g., saliva, blood, urine). The desired TB triage test would minimally have 90% sensitivity and 70% specificity, which would significantly narrow the population that needs a costly confirmatory test for active TB disease.Rationale: Recently, several reports have been published by ourselves and others on putative blood biomarkers that reflect the host response to Mtb infection through human gene expression patterns associated with TB disease. The transcriptional state of circulating blood cells reacts to Mtb infection, and this forms the foundation of a simple to administer blood test. We have discovered and preliminarily tested a gene expression signature based on three genes (GBP5, DUSP3, and KLF2) with excellent predictive powers to discriminate between healthy individuals, those with active TB, and those with other diseases (e.g., a triage TB test). Further, we have also discovered that our three-gene signature signals well before Mtb can be detected in sputum and in fact can differentiate active TB months before it becomes contagious (preclinical TB).Objective: Our primary long-term objective is to develop a finger-stick triage test using non-stimulated blood that meets or exceeds WHO Target Product Profiles for a rapid biomarker-based non-sputum-based triage test for detecting TB (= 90% sensitivity when compared with the confirmatory test for pulmonary TB and = 70% specificity against a microbiological reference standard). Our secondary objective is to extend our finger-stick test to include biomarkers of preclinical TB.Specific Aims: We will first use bioinformatics on our worldwide multi-cohort database of RNA expression to select 1-5 genes, which will increase the robustness and performance of our three-gene signature to discriminate active TB, preclinical TB, and healthy, uninfected individuals (Aim 1). We will validate our TB signature using blood from 100 TB Index Cases and 450 household contacts in the Republic of Moldova and transfer the TB signature to a cartridge useable by GeneXpert or Omni Systems (Cepheid Corp., Sunnyvale, California) (Aim 2). Finally, we will test our preclinical research prototype cartridge using blood collected from 1,000 individuals who are being screened for TB in the Republic of Moldova (Aim 3).Impact: The long-term impact of a new, accurate triage test for TB will dramatically change the way millions of TB suspects are screened everywhere in the world and will likely lead to many more cases of TB being diagnosed and treated early. An accurate test for preclinical TB by diagnosing and treating TB before it becomes contagious would be a major step toward Ã¢ÂÂthe elimination of TB as a public health treat by 2050.Ã¢ÂÂ The WHOÃ¢ÂÂs global plan to eliminate TB focuses on early diagnosis of TB and systematic screening of contacts and high-risk groups. Our test would facilitate both of these testing goals simultaneously and additionally provide for the identification of individuals who harbor TB but are not infectious to others. TB treatment is low-cost and effective, but new, highly accurate diagnostic tests are necessary to find and treat patients appropriately.Relevancy: Our proposal is important and relevant to developing improvements in the diagnosis of TB, which is a Peer Reviewed Medical Research Program Fiscal Year 2017 Topic Area, and specifically our proposal targets the focus area of Ã¢ÂÂDevelopment of a diagnostic assay that can be used at the point of care to rapidly and accurately diagnose tuberculosis.Ã¢ÂÂ Early case detection and rapid treatment with appropriate drugs are considered the most effective control strategies to reduce TB transmission. Civilians are at increased risk for exposure to TB from many transmission routes including exposure to TB-infected persons entering the United States undetected, long airplane flights, and increased exposure to TB during international travel for leisure or business. US troops are at increased risk of transmission of TB in settings with extreme crowding or limited ventilation, such as berthing areas in ships, barracks, and/or prisons, as well as exposure from visitors to bases, and environments encountered on tactical or humanitarian missions. A new test that offers for the first time a reliable test that can diagnose TB before it becomes contagious is an innovative way to stop the TB epidemic and help the US Armed Forces, US, and WHO reach its goal of eradicating TB as a public health threat by 2050.\n",

      "--------------------\n",
      "Ã¯Â»Â¿   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The impact of mitochondrial biology on human cancers is broad because these organelles are critical regulators of metabolism, proliferation, and apoptosis. Indeed, mitochondrial aberrations are common in multiple cancer types --- not only do mitochondrial dysfunctions correlate with disease pathogenesis, but aberrant mitochondria also negatively impact upon chemotherapeutic success. Within a cell, mitochondrial homeostasis is maintained by a process referred to as  mitochondrial dynamics , which is essential for mitochondrial genome integrity, efficient ATP generation, managing ROS, and the rapid distribution of mitochondrial metabolites. Mitochondrial dynamics result from the cumulative nature of two opposing forces: mitochondrial division and mitochondrial fusion. Recent published work from my group demonstrated: (1) mitochondrial division is chronically enhanced in RAS-transformed murine cells and human cancer lines harboring mutations within the MAPK pathway, (2) the mitochondrial division machinery is essential for cellular transformation, (3) targeted therapies that inhibit oncogenic MAPK signaling turn off the mitochondrial division machinery, and (4) chronic mitochondrial division is sufficient to initiate mitochondrial dysfunction and cancer cell metabolism. For decades, the presence of mtDNA mutations and mitochondrial dysfunction in cancer has been described, but the molecular mechanisms that drive these changes and their impact on cancer biology remain speculative. While others and we identified that mitochondrial division is requisite to cancer-associated mitochondrial dysfunction and is targeted by oncogenic MAPK pathway inhibitors, the molecular mechanisms linking mitochondrial division, mitochondrial dysfunction, and cancer cell survival are poorly understood. We hypothesize that oncogenic MAPK signaling induces chronic mitochondrial fragmentation, which supports mutation of the mitochondrial genome and subsequent functional heterogeneity within the mitochondrial network. This project emerged following years of effort to identify how mitochondrial division contributes to cancer biology, andwe propose three complementary specific aims. Aim 1: Establish that chronic mitochondrial division is responsible for cancer-associated mtDNA mutations and subsequent mitochondrial dysfunction in melanocytes. Aim 2: Demonstrate that chronic mitochondrial division induced mtDNA mutations link mitochondrial heterogeneity, tumorigenic potential, and metabolic plasticity. Aim 3: Reveal the broad requirement for chronic mitochondrial division in oncogenic transformation of cells and tissues. These aims will be achieved by using next-generation mtDNA sequencing, state-of-the-art mitochondrial function assays, and metabolomics approaches. Together, the results of this application will reveal that: (1) chronic mitochondrial division is permissive for mtDNA mutations, mitochondrial dysfunction, and tumorigenesis; and (2) proof-of- concept evidence that pharmacologically targeting chronic mitochondrial division may provide therapeutic potential to prevent and treat cancer.\n",

      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Parkinson disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder after Alzheimer's disease. Although dopamine replacement therapy improves the functional prognosis of PD, there is currently no treatment that prevents the progression of the disease. The etiology of PD is not well understood. Most of the PD cases are sporadic. However, approximately 5-10% of PD patients may have a clear familial history, exhibiting a classical recessive or dominant Mendelian mode of inheritance. Genetic studies in the past more than 10 years have played a vital role in understanding the etiology and pathogenic mechanism of PD. But, the power of genetic study is greatly limited because it requires sufficient number of informative meiosis, i.e. large families with both normal and affected members, especially when great genetic heterogeneity exists. It is particularly a difficult task for most of the late onset neurodegenerative disorders, including PD. Because PD is a late-onset disease with an average age of onset between 60 and 80 years, it is practically rather difficult to collect large PD families and DNA samples. Collection of a large PD family with 2-3 generations normally takes decades. Thus, collection of the large kindreds with PD represents a significant hurdle for identification of new PD-causing genes. Through a 19-year collaborative effort initiated from 1992, we and our collaborators have identified a large PD family with 67 members, among whom 11 members are affected. We have collected clinical information and DNA samples from 62 members, including DNA samples from 10 affected individuals. During this period, two affected and one unaffected members died and were autopsied. Pathological analysis of the two autopsy samples revealed Parkinson pathology, including typical Lewy bodies. But the unaffected member did not show PD pathology. These data suggest that the PD in this kindred is similar to idiopathic PD. Supported by the American Parkinson Disease Association (APDA); we excluded mutations in currently known PD-causing genes, indicating a novel PD locus. We then carried out a genome-wide linkage analysis. The known PD-loci were excluded and a candidate PD-linked locus was suggested on the short arm of chromosome 20. This project is designed to identify a novel PD-causing gene by combined use of the recently developed exome sequencing approach and the unique resources that we have accumulated in the past 19 years. The candidate gene identified in this PD family will be further tested in over 500 familial PD probands. This gene may represent the third gene with a high penetrance for autosomal dominant PD. Completion of this project may not only lead to identification of the genetic basis of PD in this kindred, but also provides the PD research community with a novel molecular target for further studies of the disease mechanisms, biological pathways and potential therapeutic strategies.

      "Ã¯Â»Â¿   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The study of the factors that control RNA expression to give rise to diverse cell types, from the same genome, has occupied scientists for more than 50 years. However, transcriptional regulation is just the beginning. Each expressed RNA can potentially adopt a new purpose as a function of its spatial position within a cell. RNA localization has been analyzed one RNA at a time because assaying RNA spatial organization on a systems-level is currently not possible. This Innovator proposal is focused on developing the methods to produce the first ever view of RNA localization on a transcriptome-wide level within cells.  We will develop a novel methodology to seek and find the cellular localization of every RNA within specific cellular locations. These methods are designed to be applicable to any cell type. By merging our technology with RNA sequencing we will construct  RNA Localization Heatmaps  to identify sites where certain RNAs are localized to. We will then integrate our data with existing datasets to understand how RNA-binding proteins direct RNAs to their cellular destinations. Our ultimate goal is to not only find where RNAs are, but also how they get there. Deciphering the molecular code for RNA organization will have broad impact on the biomedical community. Such knowledge could be used to better understand RNA-guided cellular reprogramming, design better RNA therapeutics, and further our understanding of how RNA localization contributes to normal and diseased phenotypes. This proposal is highly suitable for the New Innovator Award mechanism. Planned experiments will develop novel tools and methods to radically transform our understanding of cellular and RNA organization, while at the same time discovering an extended set of molecular  codes  that researchers could employ for RNA design.\n",

      "Foodborne illness associated with contamination fresh and processed food products are a major public health problem in the United States and internationally. Given the broad distribution of foods, particularly fresh produce, in the modern global food system, we increasingly are witnessing foodborne illness outbreaks that are very large with respect to numbers of cases and geographic distribution of cases. It is imperative for the food industry to implement more effective practices and systems to prevent and mitigate food safety hazards in fresh and processed food products. The preponderance of evidence indicates that effective education and training of food managers and front-line food workers, and implementing appropriate food safety behaviors and practices in the workplace, can prevent many foodborne illnesses. Relatively little research has been conducted to assess the impact of modern food safety systems, including those required by private food safety standards, to reduce food product contamination with microbial or chemical hazards and subsequently reduce the likelihood of foodborne illness in consumers of those products.This project will evaluate the efficacy of education and training of food managers and workers on implementation of appropriate food safety practices and behaviors. Knowledge will be assessed by assessment of training program participants. Practices will be assessed using survey instruments designed to evaluate production and processing practices by food producers and processors. Further, the incidence of selected food safety hazards and indicators of contamination will be assessed in products produced by participating firms. At the conclusion of this research, I expect to have identified production and processing practices most related to the incidence and levels of food safety hazards in selected fresh and processed food products. Further, this research will determine the potential efficacy of food safety training programs and management systems to control food safety hazards in these products.\n",

      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Project Summary/Abstract Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a significant problem for HIV-infected patients, yet the extent to which the newest CVD risk prediction tools accurately predict risk for HIV patients is not known. In this grant, we willevaluate the new American College of Cardiology (ACC)/ American Heart Association (AHA) CVD risk prediction algorithm, released in November 2013, to assess its performance in HIV patients. We will then develop a new risk prediction algorithm incorporating HIV and HIV-related factors to attempt to improve risk prediction. The rationale for performing this study is the uniqu pathophysiology underlying HIV-associated CVD, which is thought to be incompletely explained by traditional risk factors and driven in large part by inflammation and immune dysregulation. While established CVD risk prediction tools have been applied to HIV groups, there is not evidence that they are appropriate for use as they do not reflect these underlying immunologic and inflammatory changes. Accurate prediction of CVD risk is particularly important as it is a key component of the newly released 2013 cholesterol guidelines, which guide clinicians in identifying patients in need of CVD risk modifying treatment. Through Aim 1 of the proposed study, we will evaluate the new ACC/AHA CVD risk prediction algorithm, assessing the degree to which it accurately predicts CVD risk for HIV patients and hypothesizing that it will under predict risk. We will conduct a parallel analysis of the longstanding Framingham Risk Score. In Aim 2, we will develop a new CVD risk prediction algorithm tailored for use in HIV populations, for the first time incorporating HIV status as a CVD risk factor within a prediction function and hypothesizing that its inclusion will improve risk prediction beyond that by traditional CVD risk factors alone. We will refine this analysis by assessing whether inclusion of HIV-related variables indicating disease and treatment status further improve risk prediction beyond inclusion of HIV status alone. To achieve these aims, we will leverage an established cohort uniquely suited to perform the study to be conducted by a cross- disciplinary team assembled with specific expertise in the relevant fields. We will collaborate with Dr. Ralph D'Agostino and his team, who have decades of experience in risk prediction statistical analysis, to apply sophisticated risk prediction methodology in order to rigorously compare established and new risk prediction functions. Cardiovascular risk prediction is a critical aspect of HIV-related heartdisease as it underlies a clinician's ability to identify high-risk individuals in need of risk-modifying therapy. Validating the new ACC/AHA risk prediction algorithm in diverse settings and assessing the benefit of novel risk markers were specific priorities identified in the new 2013 ACC/AHA risk assessment guidelines, both of which will be performed through this study. The proposed study presents an opportunity to answer a timely question with a significant clinical and public health impact, optimizing methods for CVD risk prediction in HIV and thereby improving CVD preventative strategies for this at-risk group.\n",

      "insulin resistance glucose metabolic secretion metabolism beta sensitivity fat lipid\n",
      "--------------------\n",
      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Insulin resistance stands as a significant threat to public health worldwide, and a largely unmet medical need. To unravel the complex biology of this protean syndrome, we have endeavored to apply genetic techniques to probe gene function and tissue interactions related to metabolism, and identify tractable targets for pharmacological intervention in type 2 diabetes. Over the past five years, the notable contributions of this grant to our knowledge of the insulin resistance syndrome have been: (i) a critical reassessment of the relative roles of insulin- dependent and -independent mechanisms of glucose disposal in metabolic homeostasis; (ii) the discovery of mechanisms by which non-canonical sites of insulin action, such as central nervous system (CNS) and endocrine pancreas, play an early and decisive role in the progression from insulin resistance to diabetes; and (iii) the notion that pancreatic beta cells are an  insulin-sensitive  cell type. Building on these lessons, the PI proposes studies of the integrated physiology of insulin action that will focus primarily on the contribution of CNS, liver and enteroendocrine system to the insulin-resistant state. The PI presents data putatively identifying an  insulin-sensitive  neuron population, characterized by Glut4 expression; as well as a novel gut epithelial progenitor cell with the unique ability to give rise to bona fide insulin-secreting,  Beta-like  endocrine cells in vivo. Three aims are outlined: Aim 1 will tackle the role of insulin signaling in brain glucose metabolism, using a novel approach to identify Glut4-expressing neurons and characterize their contribution to systemic metabolism. Aim 2 will delve into the pathophysiology of hepatic insulin resistance, and specifically into the identification of transcription factors that cause the paradoxical admixture of increased glucose production and triglyceride synthesis that characterizes the diabetic liver. Aim 3 will study the role of insulin signaling in a newly identified sub-population of gut epithelial progenitor cells that express the insulin-regulated transcription factor Foxo1 and show the surprising ability to be reprogrammed into  Beta-like  cells that secrete insulin in response to glucose. The proposed body of work will advance our understanding of the insulin-resistant syndrome at the biochemical, genetic, and integrated physiological levels, with the ultimate goal of translating newly acquired information into innovative approaches to its treatment.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In the last decade, we endeavored to unravel the 'insulin code'-a concerted succession of biochemical and cell biological events that underlie the integrated physiology of insulin action. We documented the contribution of Insulin Receptor, its main substrates and signaling intermediates to the key abnormalities of insulin resistance: decreased glucose disposal, increased glucose production, and impaired pancreatic beta cell function. We used genetic techniques to probe hormonal and nutritional communication among different tissues, and analyze the progression from insulin resistance to overt diabetes. We demonstrated how tissues with insulin-dependent glucose disposal (muscle and fat) interact with those that utilize glucose independent of insulin (liver, brain, pancreatic islets) to determine various aspects of insulin resistance. We developed a theory integrating 2 cell function with insulin resistance; and delved into the pathophysiology of the brain's contribution to glucose homeostasis. We also examined the bimodal involvement of the liver in diabetes as a site of mixed sensitivity and resistance to insulin. In the process, we burrowed into the Foxo1 pathway, demonstrating the central position of this transcription factor in the regulation of hepatic glucose production and neuropeptide processing. Reversal of insulin resistance remains a critical goal of diabetes treatment, and arguably one of the largest unmet medical needs. Work supported by this grant has defined mechanisms that we believe to be new, linking insulin action in specific organs and cell types with the pathophysiology of insulin resistance, and disclosing biochemical and molecular circuits that can be exploited for diabetes treatment. We envision that the studies proposed for the next funding cycle will reveal new dimensions to the insulin resistance syndrome and expand the repertoire of currently available targets for diabetes therapy and prevention. The proposed experiments build on lessons of the past funding cycle to explore the contribution of newly identified mechanisms to metabolic homeostasis. The driving theme of our work is to define molecular pathways that can be enlisted in the clinic against insulin resistance.\n",

      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     This proposal is in response to the NHLBI's call for  Novel Methods of Monitoring Health Disparities.  The University of Wisconsin (UW) School of Medicine and Public Health (SMPH) and its partners propose to build an innovative research network to monitor the effects of economic and policy changes on cardiovascular and respiratory health in communities. The main focus will be to identify the determinants of the state's significant health inequities according to place of residence, race/ethnicity, gender, and socioeconomic status.  We will create a model information network called the Wisconsin Health Equity Network (WHEN) by linking unique existing resources that assess the health of Wisconsin individuals and communities at multiple levels. These resources include: (1) the Survey of the Health of Wisconsin (SHOW): an annual survey of representative samples of state communities and their adult residents including data on demographics, employment, medical history and health behaviors, access to health care, quality of life, as well as an individuals' physical exam and blood/urine samples; (2) the Wisconsin County Health Rankings: an annual summary of the health status of the population in all Wisconsin counties; (3) the Wisconsin Collaborative for Health Care Quality: a consortium of health care provider organizations (physician groups, health plans, hospital) sharing health care quality data; and (4) What Works-Policies and Programs to Improve Wisconsin's Health: a compendium of programs and policies that might influence health and reduce health disparities.  Funding for this program will support the expansion of the SHOW by increasing its sample size and recruitment incentives, and by adding a new rural-based field station in addition to the existing urban-based SHOW facilities in Milwaukee and Madison. It will also support the addition of a mail survey assessing health status of a representative sample of Wisconsin residents, as well as interviews with public health and health care leaders in the communities sampled each year. Methods to link the above sources of information will be developed; the use of this network of information on health, health care quality, and public health resources to assess how concurrent shifts in the global and local economy affect health disparities will be tested. Building on existing community-academic partnerships within the UW Institute for Clinical and Translational Research and the UW Population Health Institute, WHEN will engage community organizations and health professionals and will use these resources to disseminate results and identify strategies for intervention.  WHEN have national implications. It provides a finer resolution lacking in national surveys to adequately assess health disparities at the community level where multiple determinants operate. The proposed funding will leverage resources developed through a strong UW-SMPH commitment to integrate Medicine and Public Health and improve population health. Consistent with this mission, a sustainable WHEN will serve as a unique-in-the-nation model for addressing population health and health disparities.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     The Wisconsin Health Equity Network (WHEN) will expand the Survey of the Health of Wisconsin, an infrastructure for population health monitoring, and combine individual level information with data from three other organizations that monitor the quality of medical care, health care costs and public health policies in the state of Wisconsin. The Network will be a one-of-a kind model for identifying the cause of population differences in heart and lung disease, two of the most significant causes of death and disability in the United States. WHEN is built upon a population health foundation and contributes to NIH goals by enhancing public health and creating opportunities for identification of programs to reduce health inequalities.\n",

Longitudinal studies investigate environmental exposure, including physical, chemical, biological, social, behavioral, natural and built environments, on childhood health and development. The focus is on outcomes in upper and lower airway, obesity, pre, peri and postnatal outcome, neurodevelopmental. Studies share data analysis center, The National Children's Study (NCS) is prospective longitudinal cohort study of the individual and combined effects of environmental exposures and gene environmental interactions on child health and development in a representative sample of approximately 100,000 children born in the United States. The children will be followed from before birth until age 21. The importance and timeliness of this study are based on many factors, including past experiences demonstrating profound effects of environmental exposures, such as exposures to alcohol during pregnancy and to lead in early childhood on child health and development; the special vulnerabilities of children to environmental exposures compared to adults; known ongoing exposures, such as prevalent levels of non-persistent pesticides or hours of media exposure per day in young children; and evidence for environmental contributions or causes to such high-impact conditions as autism, developmental delay and developmental disability, asthma, and obesity. The primary aim of the NCS is to investigate the separate and combined effects of environmental exposures (chemical, biological, physical, psychosocial) as well as gene-environment interactions on pregnancy outcomes, child health and development, and precursors of adult disease. Unique features of the study include its focus on environmental exposures at the earliest stages of pregnancy (as well as thereafter) and the breadth of planned exposure and outcome measurements. NICHD and a consortium of federal agencies plan and conduct a longitudinal study of the impacts of environmental exposures on children.  Because the focus of the study includes assessment of the impact of exposures that occur early in pregnancy, both pregnant women and their partners, and women of childbearing age, comprise the initial target population for enrollment. Data will be collected in combinations of face-to-face contacts and remote collection methods, e.g., telephone, computer, or mail-in questionnaires. The expected frequency of contact (face-to-face or remote) is approximately every three months through age one, every six months through age five years and annually thereafter. For a sample of children enrolled in the study, visits will also be made to child care and school settings for collection of environmental samples and observational data. Anticipated biologic specimens include blood, urine, hair, and nail clippings from mothers and children; blood, urine, and hair from fathers; cord blood, umbilical cord and placental tissues, and meconium collected at/around the time of delivery; vaginal swabs, and breast milk from mothers. Anticipated environmental samples include air, dust, soil, food, and water. .\n",

      "--------------------\n",
      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is the leading cause of chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). HCV chronically infects approximately 4 million people in the U.S. and 170 million people worldwide. HCV co-infection with HIV is very common with overall 25-30% of HIV-positive persons, particularly among drug abusers with up to 70% co-infection (2). HCV infection is a major risk factor for HCC development. HCV- associated end-stage of liver diseases is the leading indication for liver transplantation. Advances on HCV research have been significantly hampered by the lack of a robust cell culture HCV propagation system and reliable small animal models of HCV infection and replication. Recent breakthroughs have been the development of robust cell culture systems for replication of HCV replicon RNAs and production of infectious HCV, which allows genetic studies of the entire HCV life cycle. However, development of small animal models of HCV infection and replication is challenging and that the lack of a reliable small animal model represents a major barrier to HCV research. Recently, we have demonstrated that genotype 2a HCV RNA replicated efficiently in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) albeit inefficiently in mouse hepatocytes. More importantly, we have demonstrated that the cDNA-derived HCV RNA inside the cell resulted in robust production of infectious HCV. A recent study by Charlie Rice's group has demonstrated that the expression of human CD81 and occludin in mouse hepatocytes is essential and sufficient for infection of HCV pseudotyped particles. These remarkable advances provide a firm foundation to develop novel transgenic mouse models of HCV infection and replication. We hypothesize that cell type-specific cellular proteins are important for efficient HCV RNA replication and that transgenic mice expressing human CD81 and occludin in hepatocytes are susceptible to HCV infection. The overall goal of this exploratory research proposal is to develop novel transgenic HCV mouse models. Specifically, we will 1) identify cellular proteins important for efficient HCV RNA replication in mouse cells using proteomics, biochemical, and genetic complementation approaches (Specific Aim 1); 2) develop novel transgenic mice that either contain full-length cDNAs of luciferase-expressing JFH1 HCV RNAs or express both human CD81 and occludin under the control of a liver-specific promoter (Specific Aim 2); and 3) determine HCV infection and replication in transgenic mice using luciferase-expressing HCV in conjunction with the administration of mouse interferon and HCV NS3 protease- and NS5B polymerase-specific inhibitors (Specific Aim 3). The successful development of transgenic HCV mouse models will represent a paradigm shift in the field of HCV research and will allow us to determine the roles and mechanisms of action of viral and cellular proteins in HCV infection, replication, pathogenesis, and carcinogenesis as well as the effects of illicit drugs and alcohol on HCV replication and pathogenesis. Additionally, transgenic HCV mouse models will facilitate the anti-HCV drug discovery and HCV vaccine development to eventually control HCV infection.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection remains a major global health problem, affecting approximately 170 million people worldwide and 4 million Americans. Our overall goal of this research proposal is to develop novel transgenic HCV mouse models for the determination of the molecular mechanisms of HCV replication, pathogenesis, carcinogenesis, and the effects of illicit drugs and alcohol on HCV replication and pathogenesis. Additionally, transgenic HCV mouse models will facilitate the antiviral drug discovery and vaccine development to eventually control HCV infection.\n",

      "--------------------\n",
      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of this proposal is to determine how changes in intracellular Ca2+, the ultimate signal of electrical activity, regulate cardiac membrane excitability. Dysregulation of Ca2+, however, contributes to cardiac arrhythmias. Given the potential pathophysiological consequences, it is not surprising that many regulatory mechanisms have evolved to control Ca2+ entry. These include Ca2+-dependent inactivation (CDI) of CaV1.2 L- type Ca2+ channels the focus of the previous proposal and mechanisms newly described by us that derived from our studies on CDI. Here we focus on novel means by through which Ca2+ influences gating of multiple channels to shape the cardiac action potential and influence excitability. Three specific aims are proposed. In the first aim, we build upon preliminary data showing that structural determination of the Nav1.5 C terminus (CT) is feasible by NMR spectroscopy. We will determine the atomic structure of the putative Ca2+ regulatory regions of Nav1.5, which will allow us to address the controversy about whether and how Nav1.5 is regulated by Ca2+. These experiments will also provide insight into atomic structure and explain function of the critical C terminus (CT) and III-IV intracellular linker of Nav1.5. Further, we will illuminate molecular mechanisms of specific inherited arrhythmogenic mutations through these structural studies. In the second aim, we recognize that CaM is but one Ca2+ binding protein (CaBP) that regulates ion channel function; in vivo Ca2+-sensitivity of ion channel function might reflect a convergence of multiple CaBPs acting upon different channel determinants. We explore novel regulation of CaV1.2 Ca2+ channels by KChIP2, a CaBP previously shown to modulate K+ currents, but not yet reported to control Ca2+ channels. The third aim focuses on how Ca2+ regulates ion channels through the activation of Ca2+-sensitive effectors, such as kinases. Building upon our previous demonstration that CaMKII interacts with CaV1.2 Ca2+ channels to control Ca2+- dependent facilitation (CDF), we propose to explore the consequences of a molecular mimicry model to understand how CaMKII and the Ca2+ channel accessory 22a subunit interact to foster CDF. Together, results from these aims will define new means by which Ca2+ can feedback on multiple ion channels to regulate membrane excitability and show how dysregulation of these mechanisms is arrhythmogenic. Public Health Relevance: Ca2+ signaling is the final common pathway of electrical activity in the heart. Dysregulation of Ca2+ signaling contributes to cardiac arrhythmias. This proposal addresses how Ca2+ feeds back to regulate cardiac ion channels and examines the structure of critical domains in ion channels that are loci for inherited arrhythmogenic mutations.\n",

      "Hepatitis C virus is both difficult to treat and a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. It is not understood how hepatitis C establishes infection nor how some patients clear infection. To this end 83 humans exposed to hepatitis C were studied in protocol 00-DK-0221. The immune response (both antibody and T cell) was closely followed and is being characterized. The study is in collaboration with Dr. Rehermann. As an extension of this 28 patients with acute hepatitis C have been followed and treated as indicated. Twenty-five patients (16 women; mean age 43 years) had adequate follow up to be included in an analysis.  Symptoms in the acute phase were reported by 80% and jaundice by 40%. Two patients (8%) developed ascites and acute liver failure but both survived.  Genotype 1 was most frequent (72%) but many patients (20%) could not be genotyped.   Serum aminotransferase levels and HCV RNA levels fluctuated greatly; 18% of patients were intermittently negative for HCV RNA.   In follow up, 5 patients recovered spontaneously whereas 20 developed chronic hepatitis C or received interferon-based therapy during the acute phase.  Among 15 patients treated during the acute phase with peginterferon with or without ribavirin for 24 weeks, all became HCV RNA negative within 4 to 8 weeks, and all except two achieved a sustained virological response with the exceptions being HIV-positive.  Side effects (particularly psychiatric) were common and limited the duration of therapy in 30% of patients.  To further understand the virological determinants of infection and the development of chronicity, the hepatitis C virus sequence in the early stages of infection has been determined from the same patients. In particular the sequencing effort is focused on the viral sequence before and after treatment, in the two patients who were HIV positive and relapsed. The complete sequence has been determined and is now being analyzed. A second laboraratory project has been to study the nature of late relapse after treatment for hepatitis C. The first 103 patients who achieved a sustained virologic response at the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center were reviewed. Three patients had a late relapse. The viral sequence from these patients was studied from before treatment, from the liver at the time of sustained virologic response, and from the serum at the time of documented relapse. The viral sequences obtained from before treatment, the liver at the time of sustained virologic response, and from the serum at the time of relapse were all virtually identical proving relapse and not reinfection. A third laboratory project currently underway is to use viral sequencing to understand discrepancies in commercial genotyping assays.A collaborative project with Drs. Natanya Sandler and Danny Doueck was to determine the relationship between markers of microbial translocation and chronic liver disease. We investigated whether the extent and progression of liver disease in patients with chronic HBV or HCV infection are associated with microbial translocation and subsequent activation of monocytes. In a retrospective study, we analyzed data from 16 patients with minimal fibrosis, 68 with cirrhosis, and 67 uninfected volunteers. We analyzed plasma levels of soluble CD14 (sCD14), intestinal fatty acid binding protein, and interleukin-6 by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) by the limulus amebocyte lysate assay, at presentation and after antiviral treatment. Compared with uninfected individuals, HCV- and HBV-infected individuals had higher plasma levels of LPS, intestinal fatty acid binding protein (indicating enterocyte death), sCD14 (produced upon LPS activation of monocytes), and interleukin-6. Portal hypertension, indicated by low platelet counts, was associated with enterocyte death (P = .045 at presentation, P < .0001 after therapy). Levels of sCD14 correlated with markers of hepatic inflammation (P = .02 for aspartate aminotransferase, P = .002 for ferritin) and fibrosis (P < .0001 for &#947;-glutamyl transpeptidase, P = .01 for alkaline phosphatase, P < .0001 for &#945;-fetoprotein). Compared to subjects with minimal fibrosis, subjects with severe fibrosis at presentation had higher plasma levels of sCD14 (P = .01) and more hepatic CD14(+) cells (P = .0002); each increased risk for disease progression (P = .0009 and P = .005, respectively). LPS-induced local and systemic inflammation is associated with cirrhosis and predicts progression to end-stage liver disease in patients with HBV or HCV infection.A second type of chronic hepatitis studied is hepatitis D. Hepatitis D is the most aggressive form of viral hepatitis as well as the most difficult to treat. Interferon therapy is the standard approach. Patients are typically treated for 6 months to a year. Relapse after cessation of therapy is the norm. In protocol 01-DK-0247 patients are treated with peginterferon for 5 years. The dose is titrated to maintain normal ALT and minimize side effects. Patients are evaluated before initiating therapy, and after 1, 3, and 5 years. Patients are excluded if they do not meet protocol-defined criteria for response at the 1 year evaluation. Enrollment was planned for 10 - 20 patients. Thirteen patients have been enrolled, and of the 12 who have had one-year evaluations 10 have met the protocol definition of response. Most of the patients were male (11) and tended to have advanced disease (median baseline Ishak fibrosis - 4). Patients were treated for a mean duration of 144 weeks (range 6 - 300) at an average weekly peginterferon dose of 184 &#956;g. At one year of treatment, inflammatory scores were significantly improved (10.6  2.7 vs. 7  1.9, p<0.01) and this improvement persisted in 4 of 5 patients who had a 3 year biopsy scored. There was no difference in the fibrosis score. ALT decreased significantly after one year (136  143 vs. 46  13, p<0.05) and persistant biochemical response on treatment was achieved by 3 patients (27%). 3/13 patients (27%) lost HBsAg after 24, 37 and 202 weeks of treatment and developed HBs antibodies. Treatment was stopped in these patients at least 24 weeks later; the serological response was durable and was associated with persistent improvement of ALT and platelet count during follow-up. Two patients (15%) died during therapy, one from hepatocellular carcinoma and the other from herpes colitis. Both deaths were not considered related to treatment. There were no other serious adverse events and treatment was well-tolerated overall. 3 patients required a dose reduction due to cytopenias. The primary end point of the study is the evaluation after three years although it is planned to treat patients for 5 years. Hepatitis D viral RNA and hepatitis B surface antigen levels have been measured, the final analysis is currently being completed.\n",

      "Stroke remains the most disabling of any neurological disease, as well as one of the leading causes of death in the United States. The annual incidence of strokes in the US is now neariy 750,000 and the most recent cost estimates of stroke care have been calculated as a staggering $50 billion. Over the next decade, the impact of stroke is likely to increase. The aging of our population and the changing race-ethnic composition could lead to an increased stroke incidence, mortality, morbidity and cost. The only approved acute therapy for stroke is IV tPA. Despite the excellent 3-month outcomes among those acute stroke patients treated within 3 hours, IV tPA is used in only 3-4% of patients suffering from stroke in the US. Part of the explanation for the inadequate penetration of IV tPA into stroke treatment stems from the public's lack of recognition of acute stroke symptoms, as well as the lack of infrastructure at the hospital level to expeditiously detect, triage and treat acute stroke patients.(1) In a North Carolina survey, 66% of hospitals did not have stroke protocols, and 82% did not have systems for rapid identification of acute stroke.(2) The Brain Attack Coalition of the American Heart Association has made recommendations for the establishment of primary stroke centers, and has more recentiy published a set of guidelines for the establishment of comprehensive stroke centers.(3-5) Based on these recommendations and a general awareness among interested participants, the acute stroke team is the cornerstone of the stroke center and consists of an interdisciplinary group of experienced healthcare workers dedicated to the delivery of eariy stroke care.(6) The 24-hour team coverage must be capable of responding rapidly to the need for diagnosing and managing acute stroke patients in the ER, as well as the hospital. Someone from the stroke team should be at the bedside within 15 minutes of being called.(7) Written treatment protocols are needed and have been shown to improve care of stroke patients and reduce IV tPA complications.(8-11) Such protocols should include the emergency care of stroke pafients, including eariy stabilization, initial diagnostic approaches, and the use of treatments that are based on guidelines or developed by the stroke team.(12)  In recent years great strides have been made in understanding the pathophysiology of ischemic stroke and testing and applying treatments for acute stroke aimed at reducing morbidity and mortality after stroke. Despite these advances, too few acute stroke patients are benefiting from these treatments. There is a gap in the ability to implement the successes of clinical trials to the treatment of stroke in the community. Two major goals of SPOTRIAS are to promote access to existing therapies through the enhancement of Stroke Center systems, and to develop new therapeufic approaches for acute stroke intervention.\n",

      "Ã¯Â»Â¿   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A Platform for Large-scale Discovery in Common Disease: Project Summary A comprehensive understanding of the genome architecture variants underlying inherited human disease phenotypes and protective alleles will facilitate improved diagnosis, prognosis, disease management, and the development of new treatments for hundreds of millions of people worldwide. In support of this goal, we propose to apply our established, state-of-the-art DNA sequencing and analysis platform to comprehensively identify rare variation influencing susceptibility to common complex diseases corresponding to three disease themes: 1) cardiovascular disease and metabolic risk, 2) autoimmune disease including Type 1 diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis, and 3) developmental and degenerative diseases including cleft lip/palate, idiopathic scoliosis and macular degeneration. Where possible, we will leverage emerging methods and technology to advance the state of the field and achieve our program goals. Our approach extends the discovery power of low-cost whole genome sequencing (WGS) with innovative laboratory and computational techniques to comprehensively interrogate the full spectrum of human genome variation. We developed these studies with substantial input from expert collaborators whose continued involvement and disease-specific expertise will be critical for success. Ultimately, the diversity of our proposed projects - in ters of disease phenotypes, sample ancestries, and study designs - will provide a better understanding of the genetic architecture of common disease and the extent to which it is shared across world populations.\n",

      "--------------------\n",
      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Traditional approaches to tissue engineering have focused on biochemical cocktails to direct cells toward tissue-specific outcomes; in some cases mechanical forces have also been utilized. However, there is also a significant literature that details the role of biophysical signaling during tissue development and tissue regeneration, which has not yet been incorporated into the field of tissue engineering to date. The field of developmental biology has tracked the role of biophysical factors, such as membrane voltage potential and ion fluxes, during tissue regeneration, in wound healing, in embryonic patterning, and in many other critical tissue- related events. These data provide a clear link between membrane potential and cell behavior that determine tissue-specific outcomes. However, many molecular details are still unclear and this novel cell control modality has not been capitalized upon to advance tissue regeneration. The focus of the present proposal is to fill this void by specifically studying biophysical regulation of bone and adipose tissue regeneration, development and patterning. We will utilize 3D human tissue systems for bone and adipose tissue. The goal is to determine the utility of biophysical factors, such as membrane potential, on tissue-specific outcomes in the context of tissue regeneration in Aim #1, tissue development in Aim #2, and tissue patterning in Aim #3. We will compare the role of membrane potential during tissue regeneration and formation to the use of traditional biochemical cocktails as the controls. In the last aim, we will focus on spatial control of tissue outcomes via light-activated regulation of ion transport, mediated via a 3D optically-addressable scaffold system, to generate tissue patterns in vitro, analogous to morphological control during limb development. The outcome of the proposed study will be an entirely new approach to the regulation of tissue formation in vitro, with implications in many areas of regenerative medicine. Understanding and exploiting the role of bioelectrical signals on tissue outcomes in non-excitable cells will provide new insight into fundamental control of tissue regeneration, as well as novel approaches toward generating complex pattern development in tissues both in vitro and in vivo.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Exploitation of biophysical control of tissue regeneration is virtually unexplored territory in the field of tissue  engineering, despite extensive studies in developmental biology that have clearly shown the importance of  changes in membrane potential and endogenous electric fields during tissue/organ development and  regeneration. Thus, the goal of this program is to determine the impact of membrane potential-regulated signaling on bone and adipose tissue regeneration, formation, and patterning. The outcome of this program would be an entirely new approach to tissue formation and control in vitro, with major implications for regeneration in vivo. Rational modulation of these powerful biophysical controls, with or without more traditional biochemical controls, will allow greater control of tissue development and function. Building upon principles from developmental biology, progress from the proposed studies will have a profound impact on the field of tissue engineering. Understanding the role of biophysical factors on tissue behavior will yield insight into fundamental control mechanisms underlying tissue growth and regeneration, offering a new perspective to the current tissue engineering paradigm. Such an understanding will also define a set of well-characterized pharmacological and molecular-genetic tools to enable novel approaches to complex tissue patterning.\n",

      "social behavior asd behavioral behaviors autism economic emotional people individual\n",
      "--------------------\n",
      "Ã¯Â»Â¿   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterized by social impairments and affects 1 in 68 US children, but remains poorly understood. Few biomarkers of ASD have been identified, hindering the understanding of its basic biology; nor are there any medications that treat the social deficits of ASD. Progress has been impeded by: 1) the difficulty of obtaining relevant tissue samples from patients and matched controls, and 2) in mouse models, the discordance between complex human behavior and laboratory-based mouse behavior, even with shared genetic etiologies. These two limitations underscore the tremendous value in developing an animal model of social deficits with more reliable behavioral and biological correlates to the human disease. Rhesus monkeys are an ideal model organism. Like humans, they are highly social, and both species display stable and pronounced individual differences in social functioning. At the behavioral extremes, low-social compared to high-social male rhesus monkeys initiate fewer affiliative interactions and display more inappropriate social behavior, suggesting both lower social motivation and poorer social skills. Naturally occurring low-social behavior in male rhesus monkeys therefore presents an exceptional opportunity to study the biology of social impairments. This research leverages a novel statistical classificationmodel which predicts, from infant behavior, subjects that are subsequently found to be low-social or high-social. On the basis of promising pilot data, we will collect quantitative social behavior data in a larger validation cohort of 1-5 year old male monkeys to confirm the discriminant power of this statistical model to be used as a robust high-throughput screening tool to rapidly identify social extremes in a large population. We will also test whether: our candidate biomarkers of social functioning (e.g., oxytocin and arginine-vasopressin; kinase signaling) correctly classify monkeys as low- social vs. high-social; the degree of biomarker dysregulation co-varies with the degree of social deficits; and cerebrospinal fluid and blood measures are equally informative. Because exclusion of females may impede identification of important disease mechanisms, we will also test, for the first time, whether our statistical classification model can be used to identify social extremes in female monkeys, and whether the same or different biomarkers predict social deficits in low-social females. Finally, we will createthe first primate social behavior test battery to better characterize the impairments of low-socialmonkeys with direct relevance to core autism symptoms (e.g., deficits in joint attention, face recognition, social learning, social competence, theory of mind, peer preferences). Creation of this battery will also allow us to test which biomarker measurements most robustly predict low-social monkey test performance to identify the most promising targets for therapeutic intervention. We are optimistic that further development of this model will accelerate the discovery of autism biomarkers and novel  druggable  targets, provide non-behavioral biometrics for treatment response, and streamline the development of the first effective autism therapeutics.\n",

      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Epidemiology of Clinical Malaria in Western Kenya Highlands Malaria is a major public health problem in Africa. An estimated one million people in Africa die from malaria each year, with the majority of fatalities occurring in children under the age of 5 in areas south of the Sahara. The African highlands (areas with elevation above 1500 m above sea level), where malaria used to be absent or very limited, has experienced periodic epidemics since the 1980's, with more than 110,000 fatalities each year. With the support of Global Funds to Fight Malaria, Presidential Malaria Initiatives and other private foundations, intensive control efforts were initiated in 2006 in Kenya. These efforts included large-scale distribution of insecticide treated nets, indoor residual spraying, and the use of artemisinin- based combination therapy (ACT) to treat uncomplicated malaria. Although these control measures appear successful in reducing malaria prevalence and incidence, there is no rigorous monitoring and evaluation program for these efforts because data on malaria prevalence and incidence are often difficult or too expensive to obtain on a large geographic scale. While hospital-based data is available, and an inexpensive source of data, there is uncertainty about the reliability of this data source. Additionally, clinical malaria incidence in the highland regions of western Kenya remains so high that intensive vector control measures and new antimalarial treatment regimes are being implemented. The objectives of this application are to determine the reliability of hospital-based malaria case data for representing natural malaria incidence and for the usefulness of this data in impact evaluation of malaria control measures, and to determine the risk factors for clinical malaria infection in areas undergoing intensive malaria intervention. I have designed two specific aims. The first specific aim tests the hypothesis that misdiagnosis, home treatment and hospital treatment-seeking behaviour are the major sources of errors in hospital-based malaria case data for representing natural malaria incidence rates. The second specific aim tests the hypothesis that clinical malaria infection risk in individual households may be affected by biotic and abiotic factors, and socioeconomic matters, and the importance of the risk factors for clinical malaria may be determined by using case-control studies. This research will answer important questions such as whether hospital-based malaria case data are suitable for malaria incidence monitoring and impact evaluation of malaria control efforts, and will help to develop new methods that target the important risk factors for clinical malaria in the era of intensive malaria control in Africa.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Epidemic malaria in the African highlands kills about 110,000 people each year and 110 million people are at risk of malaria infection. Understanding the risk factors for clinical malaria infection in the highlands will help to develop cost-effective interventions to combat malaria epidemics. The accuracy and sensitivity of hospital-based clinical malaria data is essential to measure the impact of malaria interventions.\n",

      "synaptic plasticity synapses synapse transmission glutamate neuronal mechanisms release presynaptic\n",
      "--------------------\n",
      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The 100 billion neurons in the human brain have an average of 10,000 synapses. By establishing a dynamic network of synaptic connections, the brain is able to attain the level of functional complexity that underlies human behavior. The efficiency of signal transmission at synapses is constantly being adapted in response to experience as encoded by neural activity. This synaptic plasticity is critical for the fine- tuning of brain development as well as higher brain function such as learning and memory. The plasticity of synapses is modulated and maintained by processes that are sensitive to neuronal activity and cell-cell contact. Trans-synaptic protein interactions induce differentiation of the synapse and regulate the morphology and function of synapses. Release of neurotransmitter regulates the activity of the neuron and activates a variety of second messenger pathways including calcium-signaling systems, which have a central role in regulating both rapid synaptic plasticity and long-term changes in synaptic connections through the activation of gene transcription. These activity-regulated genes then modulate the function of the neuron and can directly affect synapse function. The proposed Conte Center will investigate the inter- and intracellular signaling to and from the synapse that induce synapse formation and differentiation and regulate synaptic efficacy. These signal transduction pathways are initiated at sites of neuronal cell contact by extracellular signals and are then relayed to the nucleus and finally cycle back to the synapse to regulate synaptic function. The proposed Center brings together six leading laboratories in the study of synaptic function to take multiple interdisciplinary collaborative approaches to investigate the molecular mechanisms involved in regulating synaptic transmission and plasticity. Richard Huganir will be identifying molecules involved in the formation, differentiation and regulation of excitatory synapses in the brain. Paul Worley and Sol Snyder will be analyzing how macromolecular signaling complexes at excitatory synapses control neuronal calcium signaling and synaptic function. David Linden and David Ginty will be analyzing how calcium regulates neuronal transcription factors and gene expression. Dwight Bergles will be studying the interaction of glutamate transporters and metabotropic glutamate receptors and the role of this interaction in regulating synaptic function. All of these projects center on the synapse and address how extracellular and intracellular signals converge on the synapse to sculpt its morphology and function. Many neurological and psychiatric diseases result from defects in the development and/or function of synapses. Thus, understanding the mechanisms regulating the formation and modulation of synaptic transmission in the brain is critical for the development of treatments for these diseases.\n",

      "Part 1.The optical network of the future will have orders of magnitude increase in data rates, due at least partially to the increase in big-data transactions. These create the need for fast scheduling of network resources and agile network adaptation to most efficiently move the data across the network.  This project proposes to investigate a cognitive network management and control system, which 'senses' current network conditions and uses this information to satisfy overall performance goals. This project will be the first comprehensive research on cognitive optical network management and control. The goal is for agile automated adaptation to replace current slow, manually-driven management and control practices. The fruits of this research will have implications for next generation wireless networks and power grid systems and for fast detection of extreme events that can significantly disrupt networks. Part 2.Current optical networks are operated with predominantly static connections, with lightpaths changed quasi-statically and often remaining unchanged for months. Present methods of setting up a wavelength path result in slow changes to the network (~20 min setup times), as each of the network elements along the path is gradually tuned to avoid instabilities and transient impairments arising from rapidly introducing another optical channel into the network. Large flow and other traffic dynamics will require bandwidth adaptations of the order of ~100mS-1S.  In today's optical networks, the link quality of all adjacent wavelengths is monitored as the lightpath is turned on in several steps. The number of network parameters and their short coherence time in dynamic future networks render acquiring the complete state information of the network impractical. The idea of this project is to sense and control a small subset of the parameters with the 'largest' information content and use their relationship to tune the network. Cognitive techniques that need to be incorporated in such a strategy include sampling of network and link parameters, applying data analytics to learn behavior and cognitive techniques to operate networks, and inferring network state and optimizing performance without placing an undue network control and management communications burden on the network. This research will consider both dynamic per-session scheduling, rerouting/load-balancing and topology reconfiguration to optimize network performance.\n",

      "Ã¯Â»Â¿   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As a cofactor for thousands of enzymes, iron is an essential micronutrient. Yet, free iron is toxic because it catalyzes rapid formation of damaging reactive oxygen species. Therefore, homeostasis systems exert tight control on iron levels in all organisms and gene expression is adjusted in response to iron deprivation and iron abundance: expression of at least 100 genes is known to be iron-dependent in Escherichia coli. In humans, disruption of iron homeostasis contributes to severe diseases: iron accumulation in the brain is linked to neurodegenerative diseases, iron overload causes the liver disease hemochromatosis, and iron deficiency leads to anemia and impaired cognitive development. Furthermore, invading bacterial pathogens hijack iron out of human proteins to establish infections. These considerations underscore the essential role of iron homeostasis to human health. Because of a lack of studies examining the total cellular framework for the response to both iron deficiency and iron overload, however, how iron homeostasis is integrated into cell physiology is still unclear. Here, to address this deficiency, a two-pronged genome-wide approach is used consisting of: (1) ribosome profiling to determine how expression of genes changes over time in response to varying iron levels; and (2) genome-wide screens to identify genes that are important for survival under iron overload and iron deficiency. This approach is complemented by biochemical and genetic studies to mechanistically characterize new players in iron homeostasis. Importantly, two model systems will be investigated, the gram-negative bacterium Escherichia coli and human cells, allowing for an informative comparison of the two systems that will be essential to develop antibiotics specifically targeted at bacterial iron homeostasis. This comprehensive study will provide a time-resolved and holistic view of the response to iron and identify new players in iron homeostasis, including post-transcriptional regulators, transport systems to take up iron from different sources, and metabolic pathways that become activated in response to iron. Insight obtained from these experiments will benefit understanding of iron homeostasis diseases and treatment of bacterial infections.\n",

      "--------------------\n",
      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are an abundant class of small non-coding RNAs that regulate diverse biological processes. Recent studies suggest that a cluster of miRNAs, the mir-17-92 polycistron located at 13q31, which contains seven miRNAs including miR-17-5p, miR-17-3p, miR-18a, miR-19a, miR-20a, miR-19b-1, and miR- 92-1, may function as an oncogene. These miRNAs are highly expressed in many malignant lymphomas and other neoplasms that contain amplified 13q31-32 chromosomal fragments. It has been demonstrated that enforced expression of the mir-17-92 cluster cooperated with c-myc expression to accelerate tumor development in a mouse model of human B-cell lymphoma, and that introduction of the expression construct of the mir-17-92 cluster could enhance lung cancer cell growth. However, it is unclear whether enforced expression of this miRNA cluster can induce cancer alone or must cooperate with other gene abnormalities. Moreover, the functional mechanisms through which the miRNAs contribute to the development of cancer are poorly understood. Recently, we observed that the miRNAs from this cluster are frequently overexpressed in various acute leukemias, particularly in MLL-rearrangement leukemia, although the degree of up-regulation varies between individual miRNAs. The overexpression of these miRNAs is usually correlated with the amplification of the miRNA cluster at its genomic locus. Thus, we hypothesize that the miRNAs from the mir- 17-92 cluster play a role in hematopoiesis, and that overexpression of the miRNAs may contribute to the development of leukemia alone and/or by cooperating with other abnormalities, e.g., MLL translocations. We also hypothesize that some of the miRNAs in the cluster may play a greater role than others in leukemogenesis. In addition, we hypothesize that overexpression of the miRNAs contributes to leukemogenesis by negatively regulating expression of their target genes, particularly those that are critical tumor suppressors. We propose to explore the role of each of the miRNAs and of the different combinations of these miRNAs in proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic progenitor cells, and in leukemogenesis by using two different mouse transplantation models. Finally, we have identified 21 highly likely target genes of the miRNAs from this cluster through our recent preliminary studies, and we will validate further the miRNA- target relationship and study the roles of the validated targets in the development of leukemia by using both in vitro and in vivo methods.\n",

      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Significant numbers of older individuals experience cognitive decline with aging. The causes of cognitive dysfunction range from the devastating effects of Alzheimer's disease (AD) to normal mild forgetfulness described by most older individuals. However, the vast majority of cognitive dysfunction in older persons is related to potentially treatable disorders e.g. thyroid disease, renal disease or depression. Most older Americans receive their health care solely within the general practice setting and even mild cognitive dysfunction can impact adherence with medical interventions and impair decision-making. However, most primary care physicians (PCP) do not screen for cognitive difficulties and most older patients do not report cognitive problems. Identification of cognitive impairment at an office visit would permit earlier referral for diagnostic work-up and earlier and more appropriate treatment. To date, no studies have examined the effectiveness of providing cognitive screening in the primary care setting. We propose to screen 1000 patients age 65+ within four participating community practices for the presence of cognitive dysfunction using standardized neuropsychological tools. The four physician practices will be randomly assigned to either a  treatment as usual  (TAU) or  Cognitive Report  (CR) group. For the patients in the CR group the cognitive results will be provided to their PCP together with supporting educational activities. We will follow both groups over two years to assess outcomes of interest (e.g. change in cognition, service utilization, medications and medication adherence, PCP office and ER visits, hospitalizations, specialist referrals, mortality etc). We hypothesize that if the PCP is aware of cognitive difficulties he/she will modify patient interactions and treatment plans to accommodate the patient's level of functioning resulting in improved clinical practice and clinical outcomes. Finally, we plan to investigate a brief computerized test of cognition. Such a test could be routinely administered in PCP offices, making cognitive data readily available in the primary care setting. The results of this study will have both immediate and long-term practical and public health significance. First, this study will immediately provide PCP's with the knowledge and ability to identify, and therefore treat, patients with (1) early AD, slowing the progression of cognitive decline from the earliest point; (2) potentially reversible causes of cognitive decline thus reducing the added burden of cognitive deficits; and (3) mild cognitive dysfunction which may affect ability to follow medication regimens or treatment plans. Second, this study will help prepare PCP's to identify and manage older patients with cognitive decline as improved treatments for AD and other cognitive disorders become available over the next three-five years.\n"

      "genetic genes variants genome variation genetics identify traits association genomic\n",
      "--------------------\n",
      "The goal of the laboratory is to develop new approaches to the study of the genetic basis of cancer and its outcomes. Previously, the major focus was the analysis of common genetic variation in candidate genes in cancer and its related outcomes, particularly in immunocompromised individuals. Emphasis was on conducting pilot association studies and annotating candidate genes drawn from key pathways in innate immunity and cancer biology, such as telomere stability or nutrient transport (i.e., Vitamin C sodium dependent transport). The laboratory has developed expertise in bio-informatics and advanced genetic analyses with new platforms designed to test dense sets of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), which are the most common genetic variants in the human genome. Specifically, the laboratory has integrated approaches to identify and validate common SNPs and ancestral haplotypes, which could be used to dissect the genetic basis of disease susceptibility.  The laboratory utilizes programs and approaches in population genetics, epidemiology and molecular evolution, which assist in the choice and analysis of genetic variants under study. The same strategy has also been extended to pilot studies in solid tumors, such as osteogenic sarcoma, colorectal and prostate cancer. In addition, the laboratory has initiated study of the genetic events underlying development of Ewings Sarcoma. A population genetics approach has been employed to examine the possible contribution of genomic variation in the EWSR1 region and also to look at genetic variants on distant chromosomes that could increase or decrease risk for Ewings Sarcoma.  Recently, the focus of the laboratory has shifted to dissect the genetic basis of SNP markers validated in large scale, genome-wide association studies (GWAS). This new approach can identify new regions to be studied in great detail and eventually applied to large molecular epidemiology studies to estimate the magnitude of the effect. It will also be possible to investigate the interaction between genes and environmental factors. Moreover, these markers may identify potential genotypic differences that could bear important predictive value for disease as well as highlight potential pathways related to both disease etiology and perhaps therapeutic intervention. We have developed a series of collaborations with leading epidemiologists and bio-statisticians in the Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG). Collaborative efforts have resulted in the development of new approaches to assess the false positive report probability (FPRP), a new tool intended to better assess the robustness of findings in genetic association studies. Lastly, the long-term goals of the laboratory are to identify and characterize genetic variants that could be used as prospective tools for early detection and intervention. the studies currently underway are directed at elucidating the biological basis of the susceptibility of risk alleles. At the same time, the current strategy continues to highlight genetic variants in key pathways in cancer susceptibility and outcome.  In addition, the laboratory is closely related to the NCI Core Genotyping Facility of the NCI. The availability of high throughput sequence and genotype expertise is critical for conducting pilot studies as well as sufficiently powered, well-designed studies in molecular epidemiology and pharmacogenomics. Adaptation and integration of new informatic tools, such as Genewindow and ht-SNP selection have also been implemented.  The laboratory has focused on a series of follow-up steps based on the results of the Cancer Genetic Markers of Susceptibility genome wide association studies of prostate and breast cancer. After extensive replication studies established strong statistical significance, the laboratory has begun to study the new loci, mapping the common and uncommon genetic variants in order to nominate suitable variants for functional studies, designed to provide plausibility to strong association signals. The laboratory will conduct a series of genetic analyses designed to dissect the genetic variants associated with disease risk also discovered in GWAS of other cancers, such pancreatic, bladder and lung cancers. These studies will include deep re-sequencing to develop a comprehensive catalogue of variants necessary to generate detailed haplotypes for subsequent genotyping large case controls. In turn, functional studies will be conducted to investigate the biological basis of the contribution of genetic variants to disease susceptibility. Collaboration with other laboratories will be sought to investigate the association between germ-line genetic variants and somatic changes in related tumor tissue.\n",

      "--------------------\n",
      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adolescent substance use is common and associated with both significant negative individual consequences and substantial costs to society. The proposed study will capitalize on a cost-effective opportunity to identify neurobiological mechanisms underlying risks for, and consequences of, adolescent substance use. Tests will be conducted in adolescents with high (n= 68) and low (n = 34) familial risk for substance use disorders, selected from a larger ongoing longitudinal study that is testing causal relationships between the development of impulse control and substance use. In this new application, we seek to identify relationships between maturation of frontostriatal circuitry, impulse control development, and progression of substance use involvement across adolescence. We propose to measure frontostriatal circuitry in 11- to 14- year-old adolescents at risk for substance use disorders and to repeat assessments annually for a 5-year period. We will compare circuitry between adolescents at high or low risk for substance use disorders (based on family history) before regular drug use begins (Aim 1); determine how individual differences in early adolescent frontostriatal circuitry development, before regular drug use, predict onset and severity of substance use (Aim 2); and examine how trajectories of frontostriatal circuitry development are affected by both familial risk and adolescent substance use (Aim 3). This application posits that a) impulsive reward- focused behaviors emerging during adolescence are driven, at least in part, by inadequate regulation of the striatum due to delayed maturation of the prefrontal cortex, and b) that adolescents are uniquely vulnerable to substance use disorders and resultant cognitive impairments. This framework allows for testable hypotheses to examine neurobiological mechanisms underlying relationships observed between impulse control and substance use disorders across adolescent development. This is an opportunity to study the etiology of adolescent substance use by examining neurobiological mechanisms underlying risk for substance use disorders, impulse control development, and effects of substance use on adolescent brain development. Our study has the unique advantage of recruiting from an established and well-characterized cohort that is being followed longitudinally. A strong interdisciplinary research team is in place which combines unique expertise in substance abuse research, advanced imaging methodology, adolescent behavioral assessment, and statistical modeling. This proposal integrates distinct bodies of research on brain development, adolescent behavior, and substance abuse to advance understanding of risks and consequences of adolescent substance use.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposal integrates distinct bodies of research on brain development, adolescent behavior, and substance abuse to advance understanding of risks and consequences of adolescent substance use. This work has important implications for advancing knowledge, and ultimately may contribute to more effective treatment and prevention strategies for adolescent substance use disorders.\n",

      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV dementia (HIV-D) and HIV-associated sensory neuropathy (HIV-SN) are the most common neurological manifestations of advanced HIV infection. The prevalence of HIV-D and HIV-SN in Sub- Saharan Africa where the majority of HIV cases reside globally is largely unknown. In addition, HIV subtype may have an impact on HIV disease progression, suggesting the possibility that HIV subtypes may differ with respect to their ability to cause neurological disease. The project will assemble a cohort of HIV+ individuals in Uganda: 1) to determine the prevalence of and risk factors associated with HIV-D and HIV-SN among untreated HIV+ individuals with moderate advanced immunosuppression, 2) to determine whether untreated HIV+ individuals decline from baseline in neuropsychological test performance, and peripheral nerve function, and 3) to obtain preliminary data to determine whether HIV subtypes differ with respect to the risk of HIV-D and HIV-SN, and progression of HIV-associated cognitive impairment and peripheral nerve function. We propose one of the first large scale prospective studies of HIV-D and HIV-SN in Sub-Saharan Africa. This proposal will provide the data necessary to characterize the prevalence and progression of HIV-D and HIV-SN, which could be used for future R01 applications. HIV-associated cognitive impairment is currently not an indication for HAART initiation in HIV+ individuals with a CD4 count in the 201-350 cells/ÃÂ¿L range. Our proposal will provide the data necessary to determine if clinical practice parameters for the initiation of HAART among HIV+ individuals with moderate immunosuppression and mild neurocognitive impairment should be changed in countries within Sub-Saharan Africa such as Uganda. Our proposal will examine whether HIV subtypes may differ with respect to their ability to cause HIVassociated CNS and PNS dysfunction. The proposal will also provide training for the HIV clinician-scientists in Kampala, Uganda in research studies of HIV-associated neurological disease. Based upon our preliminary data, we believe that HIV-D and HIV-SN are frequently unrecognized complications of advanced HIV infection in Sub-Saharan Africa, and are a significant cause of morbidity in HIV+ individuals in Uganda, which if identified early, can be treated effectively with antiretroviral therapy and symptomatic therapies.

      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The overall objective of the NIDA Training Program in Drug Abuse Research at The University of Chicago is to provide both pre- and postdoctoral trainees with comprehensive educational and research experiences that will enable them to pursue distinguished research careers in areas impacting drug abuse. Drug abuse poses a serious threat to the health and well being of both individuals and society. Mental status, physical health, social function and economic productivity are compromised. Such factors can lead to an increase in crime and violence. To the credit of NIDA-sponsored research programs, considerable gains have been made over the last two decades. However, much more remains to be learned from the molecular to the social realm, especially if knowledge is to be translated into effective treatment. Existing programs in the area of drug abuse at The University of Chicago are designed to acquire knowledge about the social, behavioral, neuropharmacological, molecular and genetic factors relevant to the abuse of drugs. The aim is to increase our understanding of the etiology of and our ability to intervene in the treatment and prevention of drug abuse. Specific strengths of this program relate to the neuropharmacology, psychopharmacology, electrophysiology, genetics and molecular biology of drug abuse as well as the behavioral and subjective effects of drugs in humans. Several factors place the faculty submitting this application in an excellent position to continue to offer an outstanding training program. These factors include the strength of current interests and ongoing research into the problems of drug abuse, the diversity of approaches employed by individual faculty, the presence of a critical mass of creative scientists working on drug abuse related problems in a multidisciplinary setting as well as a curriculum that addresses the broad aspects of drug abuse ranging from the molecular bases of drug action to the consideration of ethical and social issues related to drug taking.\n",

      "cocaine addiction relapse seeking administration self nac reinstatement accumbens craving\n",
      "--------------------\n",
      "The most difficult aspect of treating cocaine dependence is the propensity for relapse to cocaine use after a period of abstinence. Cocaine dependent individuals often describe their relapse as being precipitated by cocaine craving which might be triggered by a  priming  dose of cocaine itself. Indeed, studies in laboratory animals have shown that low dose cocaine can trigger  relapse  in cocaine-seeking behavior. In rodents, dopamine (DA) D2 receptors agonists augment the priming effect of cocaine on cocaine-seeking behavior, while DA D1 receptors agonists inhibit this effect. In the current cycle of this Center, we measured with PET both D1 and D2 receptors in cocaine dependent participants and matched controls, and studied the relationship between PET measurements and increased vulnerability to cocaine primed cocaine-taking behavior. Low D1 receptor availability in the ventral striatum was associated with increased vulnerability to cocaine primed cocaine-taking behavior. This result was consistent with animal data suggesting that stimulation of D1 receptors following cocaine might be protective against cocaine-induced relapse. In the striatum, D1 receptors are mainly localized on GABAergic cells of the striatonigral or direct pathway. Thus, stimulation the direct pathwayby DA via D1 receptors might be beneficial against cocaine-induced relapse. In the next cycle of this application, we plan to study in more detail the neurochemistry of the direct pathway in cocaine dependence, by measuring both D1 receptors and kappa opiate receptors (KOR),and their predictive value on cocaine primed cocaine-taking behavior. Human postmortem datasuggest cocaine abuse is associated with increased dynorphin and KOR expression, i.e. upregulation of the kappa transmission. In the direct pathway, kappa stimulation inhibits D1 mediated signaling. Therefore the upregulation of the kappa system in cocaine abusers might impair transmission in the direct pathway. The hypotheses to be tested are that cocaine dependent participants will show increase KOR availability in the ventral striatum, and that both high KOR and low D1 receptor availability will be predictive of vulnerability to cocaine-induced cocaine-taking behavior, as studied in the laboratory. Results of these studies will lead to increased knowledge of the neurobiology of cocaine addiction and to the identification of participants most likely to benefit from selective pharmacological intervention.\n",

      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Older adults are at increased risk to develop prolonged pain and experience greater pain-related loss of physical and psychosocial function compared to younger cohorts. We propose that changes in endogenous pain modulatory capacity accounts for increased incidence of pain and disability in older adults. That endogenous pain modulation dysfunction is related to persistent pain is supported by a number of studies comparing chronic pain patients with healthy controls using a  pain-inhibition-by-pain  experimental model. Although this research group (and others) has shown age deficiencies using the  pain inhibits pain  model, other human laboratory models that are known to engage pain modulatory systems have not been tested across the lifespan, each potentially involving different mechanisms. The overarching goal of the proposed research is to characterize age-related changes in pain inhibitory and facilitatory function and to investigate the biopsychosocial mediators and clinical relevance of these changes. Our preliminary data suggest that sophisticated psychophysical methods reflecting net inhibitory or facilitatory effects are sensitive to changes across the lifespan and will provide a more comprehensive and clinically-relevant picture of changes in pain processing associated with aging. This proposed study will enroll 180 human subjects, ages 18-79, who will undergo assessment during three pain modulatory sessions at baseline. The pain modulatory tests will include inhibitory protocols; diffuse noxious controls and offset analgesia, and tests that involve pain facilitation; temporal summation, impaired decay of subthreshold pain (proxy for central sensitization), and a prolonged protocol which we have found produces greater temporal sensitization across repeated trials in older subjects. Individualized temperatures for the contact heat test stimulus will be used so that subjects experience similar, moderate levels of pain. We hypothesize that age will be associated with poorer endogenous pain inhibition from pain inhibitory protocols and increased pain from protocols that facilitate pain. A range of biopsychosocial markers will be measured that we hypothesize will mediate the association between age and variability in pain modulation. These measures include psychosocial factors (catastrophizing, sleep, stress, and negative emotions) and biological markers (blood pressure, 2-endorphin, cortisol, and other hypothalamic-pituitary- adrenal and immune markers). After establishing individual levels of pain facilitation and pain inhibition, we will assess pain during daily life and the impact of pain on quality of life using a series of telephone interviews and novel real-time electronic data capture each month for 6 months. We expect that changes in our pain modulatory tests will account for observed age differences in pain frequency, more pain intensity, number of pain sites, and in quality of life.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Older persons are at greater risk of developing prolonged pain, and when they do, they suffer a greater impact of pain on quality of life than younger persons. This study will employ cutting-edge pain testing techniques to test for changes in pain inhibitory capacity, which we hypothesize contribute to increased incidence of pain and disability in older adults. As a public health problem, the increase in numbers of elders expected in our nation's population in the coming decades render understand the mechanism behind increased pain among older adults a compelling area for research\n",

      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In recent years, successful ex-vivo immunotherapy with autologous T cells (adoptive transfer) has been reported for a variety of cancers. However, current efforts to provide therapeutic T cells for such therapy involve isolation of cells from the patient's peripheral blood, expansion and antigen specific  training  ex-vivo followed by return of the trained cells into the patient. These methods are severely constrained by (a) the difficulties and inefficiency of patient cell isolation (b) problems with expansion of primary cells in vitro (c) the morbidity associated with autologous cell therapy and above all (d) the limited availability of donor cells. In addition, the time required to  expand  and  train  patient-isolated cells for adoptive therapy can often prove to be too long for critical diseases. Therefore, technologies leading to efficient generation and expansion of therapeutic T cells from multipotent stem cells in a synthetic, controlled environment could provide a renewable, on-demand and readily available cell source for a variety of disease applications. Despite tremendous advances in the past few years in our understanding of the molecular signals involved in T cell development, the ultimate therapeutic applicability of stem cell-derived T cells require (a) Quantitative understanding of microenvironment- directed hematopoietic progenitor cell (HPC) differentiation into T cells and (b) Development of technologies for high-throughput production of functional, antigen- specific T cells suitable for on-demand transplantation. Our goal here is to engineer artificial T cell development niches (synthetic thymus-like microenvironment) to understand the effects of controlled Notch signaling in T cell development and direct human HPCs into therapeutic T cells in a scalable manner. Specifically, we propose to synthesize notch-ligand functionalized (artificial thymic stromal cells) and HLA tetramer functionalized magnetic microbeads (artificial antigen presenting cells), and evaluate how cord blood-derived human CD34+CD38- stem cells could be directed to functional, therapeutic T cells. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this two year project is to develop synthetic microbeads that mimic the micro-environmental conditions of the thymus in order to study how cord blood- derived hematopoietic progenitor cells can be directed to the T cell lineage. Specifically we would investigate how efficient notch signaling through these artificial stromal cells could trigger notch specific genes and in the presence of paracrine signals from mouse or human stromal cell signals generate early T cells. We would also investigate if tetramer signaling through magnetic microbeads (artificial antigen presenting cells) can further differentiate these stem cell-derived early T cells into more mature, CD8+ antigen specific T cells.\n",

Attaining these objectives will require focused didactic training and research guidance. Research We will develop new methodology to improve whole-brain connectivity analyses of normal and abnormal brain function. The launching of the Human Connectome Project by the NIH in 2009 underscores the importance of whole-brain connectivity analyses. Appropriately conducting these analyses is paramount in our understanding normal brain function as well as alterations due to conditions such as aging, dyslexia, and substance abuse. Before we can glean useful information from functional brain network differences in these conditions, methods need to be developed in order to permit 1) assessing several network properties simultaneously while also accounting for the complex dependence structure of the networks; 2) making predictions about the presence and strength (weight) of connections between brain regions based on disease status; 3) determining whether task related changes in brain networks are associated with clinical outcomes. The novel methods proposed here will address these needs, providing more appropriate techniques for the emerging area of whole-brain connectivity analysis. This research, along with my proposed training experiences and strong mentoring team, will facilitate my progression toward becoming an independent neuroimaging researcher with expertise in brain network analysis and enable me to make unique contributions to brain research. Training The proposed training plan consists of four elements: 1) a didactic component aimed at establishing a basic foundation in computational neuroscience and image analysis; 2) career guidance in methodological development and collaborative neuroimaging research through planned on and off-site mentoring by neuroscientists and network and neuroimaging statisticians; 3) conducting innovative research utilizing the gained neuroscientific and image analytic knowledge and previous statistical training; and 4) participating in the exchange of ideas in statistics and the neurosciences through conference and workshop attendance. The planned training activities will focus on deepening my understanding of the brain as a complex system, enabling me to reasonably model and evaluate this system within its biological context. The combination of my knowledge in network-based brain imaging statistics, computational neuroscience, and image analysis will be a valuable asset that will not be confined to a single brain disorder.

      "Work in model organisms has revealed that a small number of signal transduction pathways, including the Wnt/b-catenin pathway, play key roles throughout development, as well as in tissue repair and stem cell homeostasis in adults. Interestingly, the composition of the Wnt/b-catenin pathway differs in distinct cellular contexts, depending on expression of unique modifiers of the signaling pathway, or expression of different isoforms of conserved pathway components. We and others have evidence (see Preliminary studies) that Wnt/b-catenin signaling is repressed in pluripotent human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) undergoing selfrenewal, and that signaling is active during differentiation into both early and later mesodermal cell lineages. We hypothesize that context-dependent modifiers of Wnt/b-catenin signaling play key roles in the self-renewal and differentiation of hESCs.  The initial goal of this proposal is to test the hypothesis that context-dependent modulators of Wnt/b-catenin signaling play key roles in regulating self-renewal and differentiation in hESCs. We believe that pursuit of this goal will reveal detailed mechanisms by which Wnt/beta-catenin signaling regulates self-renewal and specification of cell fate in hESCs.  Our second goal is to expand our investigation of the roles of signal transduction pathways in stem cells to include the Hedgehog, Notch, and TGFb pathways, using novel multiplexed fluorescent reporters to enable simultaneous monitoring of multiple pathways in live cells. We believe that the development of the technology to simultaneously visualize the state of activity of multiple signaling pathways in live cells will have numerous uses in studies of signaling pathways in normal and diseased tissues.\n",

      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Obesity is a serious and growing public health problem in the United States and the world. While many overweight and obese individuals can lose weight, few can maintain weight loss for substantial periods of time. This suggests that physiological adaptations occur with weight loss that oppose further weight loss and promote weight regain. The weight reduced state is associated with alterations in meal-related hormone responses as well as long-term adiposity signals such as leptin both potentially promoting increased energy intake. While these signals may directly impact energy balance regulation, there is increasing evidence that these physiologic signals interact with reward, behavioral and cognitive systems to ultimately enhance food intake. For example, in normal weight individuals, there appear to be important interactions between environmental food-related cues and brain regions known to be important in the homeostatic regulation of food intake, and these interactions are affected by food intake and energy balance. These responses appear to be altered in obesity and more so following diet-induced weight loss which would favor increase food intake. This inability to properly adapt to the environment may represent an important mechanism for the difficulty of successful long-term weight loss maintenance. Successful weight loss maintenance interventions must, therefore, require control of energy balance via a complex interaction between physiologic and nonphysiologic systems, and understanding these mechanisms will allow for the potential development of new and/or better strategies for weight loss maintenance. Two such successful interventions are weight loss surgery and exercise. While both of these interventions have been shown to been associated with changes or 'normalization' in meal-related hormone responses that might favor reduced food intake, the mechanisms by which these interventions help promote weight loss and prevent weight regain are not well understood. Studies designed to elucidate the mechanisms of successful weight loss maintenance interventions such as these are a critical area for investigation. The overall goal of this proposal is to examine the effects of weight loss surgery and exercise on the neuronal, behavioral and hormonal response to a meal. It is hypothesized that these successful weight loss maintenance interventions will restore the normal neuronal response to a meal and that this improved neuronal response will be associated with changes in both meal associated hormones and appetite ratings. In order to examine these hypotheses we propose to use fMRI to examine the neuronal response to visual food cues before and after a meal as well as to study the hormonal response to a meal in individuals who have undergone Roux-en-Y gastric bypass or gastric banding as compared to diet control and in individuals maintaining weight loss through a supervised exercise intervention as compared to diet control.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Obesity is a serious and growing public health problem in the United States and the world. While many overweight and obese individuals can lose weight, few can maintain weight loss for substantial periods of time. This suggests that adaptations occur with weight loss that oppose further weight loss and promote weight regain. The most successful interventions for sustained weight loss are bariatric surgery and exercise. It is unclear, however, how these interventions help individuals maintain a reduced body weight. By understanding the complex interactions between the brain response to eating and food cues and physiologic changes with these interventions we hope to be able to develop new strategies and/or interventions for sustained weight loss.\n",

      "alcohol drinking ethanol alcoholism dependence consumption binge use aud abuse\n",
      "--------------------\n",
      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Learned associations between alcohol and the people, places and paraphernalia (cues) surrounding alcohol drinking represent a major barrier to the successful treatment of alcohol dependence; these associations are remarkably persistent, despite efforts to extinguish them, and can trigger alcohol craving and relapse even after long periods of abstinence. Thus, associations between alcohol and alcohol cues constitute a unique target for treatment but there is little clinical evidence of how the associations are formed, and limited empirical support for a direct effect of cues on alcohol consumption. The long-term goal of this research is to understand how alcohol cues become powerfully linked with alcohol drinking, their influences on physiology and behavior, and how they promote alcohol consumption and alcohol dependence. The objective of the proposed research project is to determine how associations between alcohol and the places where it is consumed influence ad lib drinking and the behavioral processes underlying the causal link using a de novo conditioning model in heavy drinkers. This novel model, developed in the applicants' laboratory, is particularly well-suited to studying conditioned alcohol associations because exposure to alcohol and alcohol-paired environments can be carefully controlled allowing a comprehensive analysis of the results. The working hypothesis is that alcohol conditioned cues (contexts) alter behavior and subjective responses to alcohol which mediate an increase in drinking. The rationale for the project is that vital knowledge regarding conditioned responses to alcohol contexts will lead to novel strategies to counteract responses to conditioned alcohol cues, their influence on behavior, and alcohol drinking. The hypothesis, based upon strong preliminary data from the applicants' laboratory, will be tested by three specific aims: 1) Identify mood, behavior and subjective responses to alcohol in the alcohol-paired context, 2) Assess ad lib alcohol drinking in the alcohol-paired context and determine how it is related to mood, behavior and subjective responses to alcohol, and 3) Determine how individual differences in alcohol subjective response influence the development of conditioned associations between alcohol and contexts. We believe that the proposed plan of research is innovative because it will examine how conditioned associations between alcohol and contexts are formed in humans, the influence of the conditioned associations on mood and behavior, and their direct effect on alcohol consumption. This research project is significant because it will advance and expand understanding of how conditioned associations between alcohol and cues are acquired and of their influences on alcohol reward, wanting and consumption. Ultimately this knowledge is expected to inform the development of novel strategies and pharmacotherapies to counteract responses to the conditioned cues in effective treatment approaches.\n",

      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Project Summary: Research on efficacious adolescent substance abuse interventions over the past two decades has consistently demonstrated heterogeneity of response to treatment. Key challenges for the .field include understanding these various response trajectories and establishing strategies to adapt treatments to enhance their effectiveness for those who are not responsive to standard interventions. Such research is critically needed to inform treatment services providers on optimal care strategies. An important advance in treatment services research efforts is the increasing movement away from a  one-size-fits-all  perspective inherent in standardized interventions and a call for the development of adaptive interventions that incorporate treatment algorithms to aid clinical decision-making. The Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial (SMART) outlines a process whereby a series of randomizations within an individual study is used to create an optimal adaptive intervention. We propose two studies to examine the efficacy of eight potential adaptive treatment strategies using the SMART design. Study 1 goals are twofold (1) to examine which of two distinct sets of criteria for defining early treatment response (abstinence vs. minimal use) is the best guide for subsequent treatment decisions, i.e., how best to determine when response to a minimal treatment intervention is  good enough  for an adolescent to step out of treatment without risking a significant relapse. (2) to determine which of two stepped adaptive interventions result in better outcomes for treatment non-responders and relapsers: an enhanced version of the same treatment or a new treatment? Participants (n=80) will receive an initial dose of treatment consisting of MET/CBT8. At completion, participants will be randomly assigned, in sequential steps, to one of two treatment response criteria and, if needed, one of two stepped interventions. Pre- to post-treatment outcomes will be examined using the SMART protocol framework to identify the specific clinical components comprising the optimal adaptive treatment strategy in response to a particular treatment outcome. Study 2 is a pilot (n=60) test of the efficacy of the optimal adaptive strategy identified in Study 1 vs. a standard MET/CBT 12 group intervention, with follow up assessments at 3 and 6 months post-treatment. Relevance: This research will provide a systematic set of optimal decision rules for treatment agencies on how best to proceed when adolescents receiving an initial course of MET/CBT8 show initial treatment response, persist in their substance use, or demonstrate an initial treatment response followed by later relapse. This type of  practical  clinical trial begins the long overdue process of addressing critical gaps between traditional treatment efficacy research and key questions that emerge in clinical practice such as determining when adolescents have received sufficient treatment, how to proceed when initial treatment efforts are not effective, and how best to address relapse. Mechanisms of change will also be examined in Study 2.\n",

      "BROADER SIGNIFICANCE OF THE PROJECT:   The number of researchers in the U.S. must increase significantly to preserve the global leadership in research and technology. The education of highly skilled researchers requires strong educational programs at all levels.   Research experiences can greatly influence the future and motivation of young engineers and scientists and can provide professional, intellectual, and personal benefits for undergraduate students.. By performing research projects related to a disease that affects more than 25 million people in the U.S., we have the potential to advance understanding while influencing your engineers in their career. The program specifically targets students without previous research experience. This focus combined with support from community college programs will provide the opportunity to impact students at critical career transition points. In addition to research experience students are provided with a broader understanding of the disease and its impact on society. The program impacts students at multiple academic stages. Mentoring activities will be provided and fostered for graduate students to facilitate interactions with the REU student, and REU students will develop an enrichment activity for a high school STEM program. The high school students are from diverse backgrounds and will be exposed to cutting edge engineering research and opportunities for impact in the field of diabetes.   PROJECT DESCRIPTION:  The primary goals of this program in the Biomedical Engineering (BME) Department at the Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT) are: 1) Students will experience engineering research by completing challenging diabetes-related projects with faculty at IIT.  2) Develop and apply mentoring in graduate and undergraduate researchers. 3) Expose student to the broader health implications of their research. 4) Provide engineering research experiences to students without previous experience with an emphasis on students from community colleges. 5) Integrate ethics discussion and training into all aspects of the student experience. Laboratory experience is an essential component of this research proposal. However, seminars, mentoring workshops, ethics training, a K-12 outreach activity and tours of clinical facilities are provided to enhance the experience.    Upon completion of the summer program students will have a diverse set of research skills and knowledge by completion of the following specific objectives: Specific Objective (S.O.) 1: Students complete a diabetes related research project working with an engineering mentor from IIT.  S.O. 2: Increase participation by targeted student populations, specifically students without previous research experience and those from colleges and universities where research opportunities in STEM are limited. S.O. 4: Develop and apply mentoring skills in graduate and REU students through training and interactions with students at multiple education levels.  S.O. 4: Increase student knowledge of the health implications related to diabetes and the importance of engineering research.  S.O. 5: Communicate research ideas and findings through both informal discussion and formal presentations.

      "--------------------\n",
      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): How proteins fold, that is attain their three-dimensional structure, is a fundamental biological process with important implications for human health. Misfolded proteins are often toxic, as illustrated by the number of neurodegenerative diseases referred to as  protein folding diseases . Molecular chaperones play vital roles in remodeling protein structure -- assisting de novo protein folding, preventing protein aggregation and disassembling protein complexes. Hsp70-based machineries, having J-proteins as obligate components, are amongst the most highly conserved molecular chaperone systems. J-proteins are a very diverse set of proteins, having only the 70 amino acid J-domain in common. All J-proteins share the ability to stimulate the ATPase activity of their partner Hsp70s, allowing them to capture client proteins. But it is their functional diversity that enables them to orchestrate Hsp70's capacity to participate in a wide array of complex and diverse biological functions. This proposal focuses on understanding the basis of the specificity of J-proteins function. Two J-proteins of the yeast cytosol have been chosen for in depth analysis: Sis1 and Zuo1. This choice is based on their critical importance and their high degree of sequence conservation. Their human homologs are able to substitute for the yeast proteins, thus the outcome of this work will serve as a paradigm for understanding J-protein function in other organisms. To understand the specificity of Sis1, its function in the propagation of yeast prions will be exploited, as it is specifically required for fragmentation of prion complexes. Thus, results will also yield important information about the biogenesis and propagation of these self-replicating amyloid protein aggregates. Zuo1 is a highly conserved ribosome-associated chaperone that facilitates interaction of Hsp70 with nascent polypeptides as they exit the ribosome. Ribosome-associated chaperones serve as a link between protein synthesis and protein folding and are thus a key to the cell<s production of functional proteins. In addition, we will investigate roles of molecular chaperones in the nucleus, focusing on novel regulatory functions independent of and separable from chaperone activity. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The research described in this proposal focuses on understanding the processes of protein folding and maturation within living cells and the important roles of molecular chaperones in them. Productive protein folding is critical to normal cell function; protein misfolding is the primary cause of many human diseases, including cystic fibrosis and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease.\n",

      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mice have triumphed as the in vivo experimental model system of choice in biomedical research. However, there are clear limitations to mouse models. The literature is full of therapeutic approaches that worked in mice but failed in humans. Further, mice often provide less than optimal mimics of the human diseases being modeled, atherosclerosis being a prime example. Compared to humans, mice are very resistant to atherosclerosis. In part, this is thought to be due to fundamental differences in lipoprotein metabolism between species. Available mouse models are thus based on dietary or genetic perturbations in lipoprotein metabolism; all have drawbacks. While mouse models have provided important insights into pathogenesis, fundamental biological and practical problems with available models have hindered translation of principles derived from mouse studies to human disease. As with other difficult-to-model diseases, this has been presumed to be due to basic biological differences between species. Indeed, mice are not humans. However, data strongly suggest that the environmental conditions ubiquitously employed in mouse husbandry impair our ability to model atherosclerosis in mice. The studies in this exploratory/developmental proposal address the novel hypothesis that the severe cold stress that laboratory mice are ubiquitously subjected to (a practical  paradigm  employed systematically for nonscientific reasons - the comfort of their clothed human handlers) profoundly affects mouse physiology and immunology in ways that directly impair the modeling of atherosclerosis in mice. Notably, the adaptive response to cold stress involves sustained activation of the sympathetic nervous system and glucocorticoid production, both of which potently suppress the activation of macrophages-cells critical to disease pathogenesis at all stages of atherosclerosis. Furthermore, housing mice in the absence of cold stress has been reported to  humanize  their plasma lipoprotein profiles. The studies in this will thus directly and rapidly test the hypothesis- one strongly supported by data available in the literature - that current mouse models of atherosclerosis are undermined, fundamentally, by the chronic cold stress associated with standard mouse housing conditions. If the hypothesis is correct, this proposal has a clear, important deliverable-the development of a tractable, humanized mouse model of atherosclerosis that would provide a critically needed novel tool for research into atherosclerosisbiology and therapy.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Laboratory mice are central to the biomedical research enterprise. This proposal seeks to develop dramatically better mouse models of human atherosclerosis by altering a key, ignored environmental variable: temperature. We hypothesize that the cold stress that laboratory mice are ubiquitously subjected to (for largely non-scientificreasons) impairs the modeling of human atherosclerotic disease in mice. The development of a tractable, humanized mouse model of atherosclerosis would provide a critically needed novel tool for research into atherosclerosis biology and therapy.\n",

      "Cancer Screening in Healthy Older Adults: Understanding Quality of Life-Evidence Review  Further the Evidence Review being pursued by AHRQ to understand Cancer Screening in Healthy Older Adults and the Effect of Quality of Life Measures on Screening Decisions.  Support for an analysis of quality of life metrics to include a review of: existing measures, the consistency of current measures, and usefulness of existing measures as outcome measures in evaluating effectiveness of preventive services in older adults. Specifically, few policy statements about cancer screening give guidance about when to consider ending screening in older adults. Decreasing life expectancy, increasing comorbidities, and competing causes of death may be leading to less benefit and potentially more harm from screening interventions in older adults. Life expectancy is also extending and the population of older adults is expanding. In addition the analysis will include how existing measures of quality of life predict or explain decisions about screening, especially with respect to cancer, by older adults. This analysis will fill a recognized need for a thorough understanding of quality of life measures that was identified during a recent review on primary care relevant interventions to prevent onset of functional limitations. With this IAA we propose to address this need and advance the methodologic work in evaluating prevention in older adults. Improved understanding in this area is key to the understanding of factors relevant to cancer screening decision making in older adults. As the U.S. population ages, primary and secondary clinical preventive services have become important issues for clinicians and policy makers. Few policy statements about prevention give guidance specific to older adults that consider how benefits and harms may be different in older adults than in younger adults. Decreasing life expectancy, increasing comorbidities, and competing causes of death may be leading to less benefit and potentially more harm from clinical preventive services in older adults. There are challenges in evaluation of the evidence in older adults and in applying the evidence to developing recommendations specific to older adults. A specific challenge is determining when the net balance of benefits and harms becomes negative; that is, the harms begin to outweigh the benefits. One important consideration is how quality of life affects the estimation of benefits and harms of clinical preventive services.\n",

The study includes: (1) interviews with mothers and fathers at birth and again when children are 1, 3, 5 and 9 years old, (2) medical records for a subset of mothers and children at birth, (3) in-home assessments of children and their home environments when children are 3, 5, and 9 years old, (4) interviews with children at age 9, (5) interviews with teachers when children are 3, 5, and 9 years old and (6) DNA samples from mothers and children when children are age 9. The study also includes in-depth, longitudinal interviews with a subset of approximately 75 couples during the first four years after the child's birth. The study design called for a large oversample of births to unmarried parents, and thus the data are a valuable resource for studying health disparities among minority and economically disadvantaged populations. To date, more than 1300 researchers have downloaded the public use data, and Google Scholar lists 730 scholarly articles, theses, books, and abstracts using the FFS data for the period covered by the current NICHD grant, 2006-2011. We seek funding to conduct another round of interviews with mothers and children when children are 15 years old. Our specific aims are to:   Update information on children's health and development and collect new data on health and health risk behavior, school performance, and anti- and pro-social behavior when children are age 15   Update information on contextual factors, including families, neighborhoods, schools and peers, when children are age 15, including retrospective data on family experiences since the last interview  Collect saliva samples from 3,600 children at age 15 to be used for future methylation analysis Approximately 3600 mothers and 3100 children will be interviewed via phone. These phone interviews will be 55 minutes for mothers and 45 minutes for children. Five hundred adolescents will be interviewed in person for approximately 1 hour.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will extend the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study (FFS), a nationally representative, birth cohort study of approximately 4900 children born in large US cities (populations of 200,000 or more) between 1998 and 2000, by collecting data from mothers and adolescents when the children are 15 years old on children's health and health risk behavior, school performance, and anti- and pro-social behavior; on contextual factors, including families, neighborhoods, schools, and peers; and on methylation using saliva samples from 3600 children at age 15. Adolescence is a critical period in human development when children engage in both positive and negative behaviors that are known to have lasting consequences for future health and wellbeing. The new data will dramatically increase our knowledge of how children's experiences in early and middle childhood influence adolescent behaviors and, ultimately, health and wellbeing in adulthood.\n",

      "--------------------\n",
      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Emerging evidence highlights the importance of non-nicotine, sensorimotor factors (e.g., taste, aroma, handling) in cigarette addiction. Smokers prefer denicotinized cigarettes over i.v. pulses of nicotine, and blockade of the sensory aspects of smoking significantly reduces smoking satisfaction and reinforcement. Moreover, new treatments that address dependence on non-nicotine components of tobacco addiction have shown promise. Despite recent appreciation of non-nicotine, sensorimotor factors in cigarette addiction, little is known about the neurobiological basis of nicotine versus non-nicotine components of tobacco addiction. Thus, the broad objective of this research is to evaluate the neurobiological basis of nicotine and non-nicotine factors underlying cigarette addiction by systematically varying administration of these factors and measuring their effects on brain function using fMRI. In a fully factorial design, thirty-six (36) smokers will undergo imaging following 24 hrs of: 1) nicotine patch + smoking denicotinized [denic] cigarettes, 2) placebo patch + smoking denic cigarettes, 3) nicotine patch only, and 4) placebo patch only. Two tasks differentially sensitive to nicotine and non-nicotine factors a continuous working memory task (CWM) and a cue-reactivity task (CR), respectively will be completed. We hypothesize that abstinence from nicotine (regardless of smoking) will result in poorer CWM performance and decreased activation of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC); while abstinence from smoking and nicotine will result in greater abstinence-induced craving and increased activation in a network of cortical, limbic and striatal regions. Individual differences in self-reported smoking motivation and other smoking-related factors will predict the effects of nicotine and non-nicotine factors on brain functioning. In addition, a sample of 36 nonsmokers will also be scanned and smoker-nonsmoker group differences will be examined. The findings of this study will shed new light on the neurobiological basis of tobacco dependence and provide a framework for understanding individual differences in tobacco use, withdrawal and relapse. Moreover, it will provide basic science information that will aid in development of new and potentially more effective treatments that address both nicotine and non-nicotine components of smoking. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Cigarette smoking is the leading cause of death and disability in the United States. There is a growing appreciation that factors other than nicotine contribute to the addictiveness of tobacco smoking. These include both sensory (taste, aroma) and behavioral (puffing, handling) factors. A better understanding of how these factors affect the brain can lead to new and more effective treatments to help smokers quit.\n",

ObjectiveThe objective of the Data Management and Analysis Core is to continue to provide data managementservices and statistical expertise to Program Project investigators in a wide range of data acquisition andanalysis activities. Integral to the goals of each project is the management and analysis of Core observational,interview, questionnaire, and behavioral data, as well as management and analysis of data from the individualprojects. Data management activities draw on the considerable resources of the Data Management andAnalysis Center (DMAC) at the Frank Porter Graham Child Development Center (FPG) at UNC and TheMethodology Center (TMC) at PSD. Specific Aims of the Data Management and Analysis Core are to:1) Implement the planned missing design in conjunction with the Executive Committee.2) Develop and maintain data management strategies that process data collected in the common protocol andthe individual projects efficiently and accurately.3) Design and maintain integrated databases of project and common protocol data.4) Develop and implement data analysis plans using innovative analytic methods for longitudinal dataincluding variable-centered and person-centered approaches to address research questions incollaboration with project investigators.5) To set in place a data archiving system for data sharing.These goals require the collaboration of experienced statisticians and computer programmers. The DMACprogrammers have expertise in all aspects of quantitative data management, from the entry and tracking ofdata to the generation of analysis files and statistical programming. The DMAC and TMC statisticianscollaborated with these and other investigators regarding design and statistical issues across many earlychildhood research projects. The Data Management and Analysis Core provides high level expertise to theProgram Project in each of these areas. The use of an experienced data acquisition and analysis center toprocess and analyze data across the projects will provide both high levels of quality control and costeffectiveness.A central data acquisition and analysis center is especially important for this Program Project because datafrom each project contributes to the common protocol for use by all projects in addressing their hypotheses.In particular, executive functioning and self regulation measures collected by Project I, classroom observationsand child cognitive/academic outcomes collected by Project II, and family process measures collected byProject III, and community measures from the core are primary predictor or outcome measures used inanalyses by all projects. Central coordination of data processing and analysis will ensure the consistent andtimely processing of these ÃÂ¿data^for-all- inyestigatgrsv Careful documentation of data scoring, including the reliability and distributions of summary variables, will facilitate the use of one project's data by other projectinvestigators.The services provided by the Data Management and Analysis Core pertain to almost all phases of theresearch including design, data collection, data entry, and analysis. The main advantage of having acentralized facility for data management and computing is the ability to provide coordinated services thataddress the wide range of issues involved in these activities. By coordinating data processing activities for allprojects, duplication of effort is reduced, efficiencies of data management and analyses are generated, andopportunities for higher level analysis across data sets from different projects are made available. Thus,maximum communication is obtained across all projects to further the understanding of data to be analyzed, aswell as the statistical procedures for those analyses. Furthermore, synergy among projects is enhancedthrough having the same programmers and statisticians working across projects.\n",

      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Quality sleep is imperative for the maintenance of good health.  Persons suffering from sleep disturbances are not only fatigued but have impaired memory and learning, increased stress and anxiety and decreased quality of daily life.  Sleep disturbances are twice as common among women compared to men.  Complaints by women of insomnia, disturbed sleep, difficulty returning to sleep and fatigue rise sharply during their menopausal years when estrogen levels decrease markedly.  Studies from a number of different species, including humans, suggest that sex hormones (estrogens, progestins and androgens) influence the physiology and pathology of sleep.  However, the molecular and cellular mechanisms by which hormones act to influence sleep behavior are unknown.  This proposal seeks to investigate potential molecular pathways through which hormones influence sleep.  The rat serves as a valuable model in this regard because of the extensive knowledge on general sleep patterns already gained.  The goal of this proposal seeks to investigate the role of estradiol in the modulation of the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying sleep/wake behavior.  We hypothesize that the effect of sex steroids on sleep patterns is mediated by steroid-induced changes -  the expression of signaling compounds, such as prostaglandin D2 and gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA), in key brain nuclei that are involved in the regulation of sleep and wakefulness.  Numerous sleep surveys report women experience considerably more sleep problems than men.  However, hormonal modulation of sleep homeostasis is a severely unrepresented area of research.  In fact, the 2003 revision of the National Sleep Disorders Research Plan indicated that  enhanced efforts are needed to better understand the neurophysiology of sleep and the neuropathology of sleep disorders in women  and that more basic science research addressing the mechanism of sex hormone modulation of sleep is needed.  The potential findings of this research will advance our understanding of steroid associated control of sleep and how changes in hormonal function lead to sleep pathologies, which in women have been medically correlated with mood disorders.\n",

      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hypertension is the most common modifiable risk factor that leads to the major causes of death and disability in the US. It is a complex, heritable disease of multi-factorial etiology that involves the interactions between environmental factors and multiple genetic susceptibility alleles. It is postulated that the high prevalence and more virulent course of hypertensive vascular disease among African-Americans reflects a critical interplay between genes and environment that is mediated by the vascular epigenome. The pathogenesis of hypertension-induced vascular complications (e.g. stroke) involves long-term changes in vessel function and structure. However, the molecular mechanisms of vascular 'memory' that govern these chronic changes remain poorly defined. Our central hypothesis poses that the chronic maintenance and progressive nature of vascular disease in hypertension is mediated by dynamic changes in the vascular epigenome that promote the selective up-regulation of a  vasculopathic  gene expression profile as well as the coordinate repression of intrinsic  vasculo-protective  genes. The proposed project will utilize genome-wide, deep sequencing technology to characterize a topographical map of DNA and histone methylation marks associated with changes in the hypertensive vascular transcriptome as well as define the dynamic response of the vascular epigenome to therapeutic interventions. We will test several related hypotheses:   There is a distinctive 'molecular signature' of the vascular transcriptome and a corresponding epigenomic pattern of DNA and histone methylation that is characteristic of the microvasculature of African-Americans with hypertension compared to age-matched African-American controls without hypertension.   The clinical efficacy of pharmacologic blockade of angiotensin II in the treatment of hypertension is mediated in part by its distinctive, dynamic effects on the epigenomic pattern of DNA and histone methylation and its consequent influence on the vascular transcriptome.   The blood pressure lowering efficacy of the DASH diet is mediated by specific, nutrient-responsive elements in the vascular epigenome and its consequent effects on the vascular transcriptome. Overall, this project holds promise for creating a unique Epigenomic Data Resource and a novel integration of genetics, epigenetic, nutrigenomics and pharmacogenomics in a common, clinically significant disease that contributes to racial/ethnic disparities in cardiovascular health. It is anticipated that these studies will yield novel insights and new drug discovery paradigms for the treatment of hypertension. Public Health Relevance: High blood pressure affects 1 in 3 adults in the US and is a major cause of strokes and heart attacks. It involves the interplay between genetic predisposition and external factors such as diet (e.g. high salt intake). The pathways that mediate the long-term effects of diet on the function of the blood vessel are unknown. This project will test the hypothesis that the expression of genes that promote or protect individuals from hypertension is modulated by epigenetic marks or codes that are responsive to changes in dietary nutrients.\n",

      "inflammatory inflammation pro macrophages anti immune macrophage cytokines sepsis atherosclerosis\n",
      "--------------------\n",
      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Atherosclerosis is the leading cause of death in the United States and is now widely recognized as a chronic inflammatory disease occurring within the artery wall. The macrophage is the key innate immune cell type implicated in atherogenic inflammation, a pathophysiology largely driven by alterations in transcription. Work over the past two decades has identified pathways initiated through cell surface toll-like and cytokine receptors which culminate in the activation of NF-kB, AP1, and Stat proteins and subsequent transcriptional activation of pro-inflammatory genes encoding cytokines, chemokines, and matrix remodeling enzymes. The means and mechanisms by which pro-inflammatory genes are attenuated, however, remain poorly understood. Peroxisome proliferator activated receptors (PPARs) are lipid-sensing nuclear receptors and represent a nexus between nutrition, metabolism, and inflammation. Importantly, two PPAR isotypes are expressed in macrophages, PPARg and PPARd, and synthetic activators of each of these receptors are anti-inflammatory and anti-atherosclerotic in mouse models. Little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying these therapeutic effects, but existing data suggest that interactions with the represser proteins NCoR and BCL6 may be central to their anti-inflammatory actions. A central hypothesis of this proposal is that inflammation can be modulated at the transcriptional level by PPARs and their repressors. We will elucidate roles for three components of the PPAR repressor complex, including BCL6, SMRT, and NCoR in macrophage- elicited inflammation, atherogenesis, and PPAR anti-inflammatory control. Experiments will take advantage of unique mouse knockout, knock-in, and knock-down models and utilize biochemical, molecular, and physiologic approaches. RELEVANCE (See instructions): These studies will further our understanding of inflammation and atherosclerosis, focusing on the mechanisms by which PPARd exerts its anti-inflammatory effects. Insights from this work may identify targets for new types of anti-inflammatory drugs or next-generation PPAR compounds designed to improve the treatment of atherosclerosis and other inflammatory diseases.\n",

      "--------------------\n",
      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): While most DNA exists in the canonical B-DNA form, repetitive DNA sequences can form alternatively structured DNA (or non-B-DNA) such as H-DNA and Z-DNA. These non-B DNA-forming sequences are abundant in mammalian genomes and are often associated with diseases such as Fragile X Syndrome, Huntington's disease and myotonic dystrophy. We have found that H-DNA and Z-DNA-forming sequences are highly mutagenic in mammalian cells and in mice, and often co-localize with chromosome breakage hotspots, such as in the promoter region of the c-MYC gene that maps to a translocation breakpoint hotspot in Burkitt's lymphoma. Furthermore, the mutagenic H-DNA and Z-DNA-forming sequences stimulate DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), leading to deletions and translocations, implicating them in translocation-related disease etiology. In addition to their intrinsic instability, it has been demonstrated that DNA damage from exogenous sources may be enriched in non-B-forming sequences and this damage may be refractory to repair. UV irradiation from the sun is a ubiquitous environmental carcinogen that we are exposed to on a daily basis and has been associated with cancers such as melanoma. In B-DNA, UV irradiation causes the formation of DNA lesions such as 6-4 photoproducts (6-4PPs) and cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs). However, how exogenous DNA damaging agents such as UV irradiation affect H-DNA and Z-DNA structure formation, stability, and mutagenic potential is not well understood. Our long-term objectives are to understand how UV irradiation affects non-B DNA structure-induced genetic instability in human disease. The immediate objectives of this proposal are to test the hypothesis that non-B DNA regions will be more prone to UV irradiation damage, and more refractory to repair than B-DNA. We will test this hypothesis using a mammalian cell system and a mutation reporter assay our lab has previously developed. Specific Aim 1 addresses the mutagenic potential of non-B DNA sequences after UV exposure. The mutagenic potential of non-B DNA after UV irradiation will be tested in mammalian COS-7 cells using our mutation reporter assay. Specific Aim 2 addresses the potential of UV lesion formation within and surrounding non-B DNA-forming sequences and structures. We will determine how non-B DNA structures affect lesion formation and how lesion formation affects the formation of non-B DNA structures. Specific Aim 3 characterizes the repair pathways involved in processing UV lesions at the non-B DNA structures using cell lines deficient in different repair proteins.\n",

      "bone fracture osteoporosis marrow pth fractures loss resorption skeletal formation\n",
      "--------------------\n",
      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Patients with insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM; Type 1 diabetes) display higher bone loss and increased risk for osteoporosis and related bone fractures. However, the mechanisms that underlie bone loss in IDDM are still not fully understood. It is well established that bone mass is maintained by bone remodeling, a process that involves formation of new bone by osteoblasts and osteocytes and resorption of existing bone by osteoclasts. Bone remodeling is regulated by mechanical stimuli imposed continuously to the skeleton by physical activity, and proper response of osteocytes/osteoblasts to mechanical loading is thus essential for maintenance of bone function and skeletal integrity. The main goal of this R01 application is to test the novel hypothesis that altered expression of components of bone mechanosensory and transduction systems is a central mechanism leading to bone cell dysfunction and higher bone loss in IDDM. For this we will use comprehensive in vitro studies with bone cell lines that will be uniquely combined with in vivo bone physiology and in situ bone tissue analysis on the Type 1 diabetic Akita mouse model. The proposed in vitro studies will provide mechanistic insights into effects of high glucose on bone cell detection and response to mechanical stimuli. The in vivo and ultimate in situ studies with control age- matched and Akita mice treated with or without insulin will determine the impact of diabetes and associated high glucose on bone formation in response to mechanical loading, and evaluate the contribution of altered bone mechanosignaling to the higher bone loss in diabetes. These studies will be directed by a new investigator who has a background in biomedical engineering and has begun a first faculty appointment in a Department of Orthopaedic Surgery. Studies will combine the broad expertise of junior and senior researchers in the areas of biomedical engineering, pharmacology, physiology and molecular biology, and state-of-the-art biochemical, live cell imaging, histomorphometric studies and non-invasive in vivo whole animal bone imaging. The proposed studies are not only expected to advance understanding of mechanisms underlying diabetic osteopenia, highlighting the deleterious effects of high glucose on bone mechanosensory/transduction systems, but will also bring awareness to the importance of an early and tight glycemic control to prevent and reverse bone loss in diabetes.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Diabetes mellitus is associated with increased bone loss and risk for osteoporosis and bone fracture. The proposed studies will investigate a novel mechanism to explain diabetic osteopenia. If successful, they will not only markedly advance our understanding of mechanisms underlying bone loss in diabetes but will also bring awareness to the importance of an early and tight glycemic control to prevent and reverse diabetic osteopenia.\n",

      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality among patients with chronic kidney disease. This excess risk is only partly attributable to a high prevalence of traditional cardiovascular risk factors. The principal investigator's goal is to establish a career as an independent investigator with the broad objectives of understanding of the pathophysiologic mechanisms leading to cardiovascular disease and developing effective preventive strategies to reduce the burden of cardiovascular disease in kidney disease. The proposed study will investigate the mechanisms underlying development of cardiovascular disease in the earlier stages of non-diabetic chronic kidney disease utilizing data from two National Institutes of Diabetes & Digestive & Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) sponsored trials. The overall hypothesis is that: Non-diabetic chronic kidney disease is characterized by early elevation of markers of inflammation, oxidative stress and insulin resistance, and that these risk factors are associated with cardiovascular disease in this patient population.  The Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) Study was a large randomized controlled trial of patients in the earlier stages of chronic kidney disease. Participants in the MDRD Study had predominantly non-diabetic kidney disease of varying etiologies. The Halt Progression of Polycystic Kidney Disease trial is a randomized trial to slow the progression of kidney disease in patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). These two patient populations provide a unique opportunity to examine the relationship between kidney disease and novel cardiac risk factors, and to study the role of these novel risk factors in the pathophysiology of cardiovascular disease, in the absence of important confounders such as diabetes, dialysis and malnutrition.  The study hypothesis will be tested using three specific aims: 1. To determine whether inflammation, oxidative stress, insulin resistance, and endothelial dysfunction in the earlier stages of chronic kidney disease are associated with cardiovascular disease. 2. To determine whether ADPKD is associated with inflammation, insulin resistance, and oxidative stress 3. To determine whether inflammation, insulin resistance, and oxidative stress are associated with endothelial dysfunction, measured as brachial artery reactivity and peripheral artery tonometry, in ADPKD.  The novel risk factors under investigation in this proposal could serve to identify high-risk patients for targeted interventions to prevent or delay the adverse outcomes associated with cardiovascular disease. The applicant has chosen a group of distinguished mentors and collaborators to support this project. This award will provide Dr. Menon with the final training necessary for her to make the transition from trainee to principal investigator.\n",

      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Researchers have had enormous success in furthering our understanding of aging through the study of short- lived animal models, including nematode worms, fruit flies, and mice. However, there is a fundamental gap in our knowledge of how well these models can explain aging phenomena in humans. The long-term goal of the work proposed here is to develop a relatively short-lived primate, the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), as a powerful model to better understand the biology of aging in humans and non-human primates. The objective of this application is to examine how complex metabolic pathways change with age in marmosets, and to determine how these alterations contribute to longevity and frailty. The central hypothesis of this work is that disruption of co-regulated metabolic modules will progress with aging and will predict age-associated dysfunction and survival. Moreover, dietary restriction, a well-established intervention to delay aging in a variety of species, will prevent or delay degradation of these metabolic relationships and pathways. The rationale for the proposed research is that once we identify metabolic modules that are associated with aging in marmosets, we will be well-positioned to further develop the marmoset as an outstanding aging model and, importantly, to study the proximate molecular factors that determine variation in rates of aging both within and among individuals. The central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: 1) to perform a longitudinal study on the NEPRC common marmoset colony to identify metabolic profiles associated with longevity and functional measures of aging; 2) to validate and curate a marmoset metabolomics aging database; and 3) to examine effects of caloric restriction (CR) on metabolic profiles and age-associated dysfunction in marmosets. The work proposed here is innovative, because it develops a novel animal model for aging research, and a novel network approach to study mechanisms of aging in genetically variable populations. Moreover, the interdisciplinary research team created for this project is particularly well suited to bring the work proposed here to fruition. The work proposed here is significant because it will provide the broader research community with a primate model of aging that is more tractable than the existing, longer-lived model systems, and it will introduce a powerful, conceptually novel and easily implemented set of network analysis tools to study the underlying mechanisms of aging in natural populations. Ultimately, this knowledge has the potential to increase understanding of the mechanisms that cause variation in rates of aging among traits within individuals, and among individuals, in human populations.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project is to develop a relatively short-lived primate, the common marmoset, as a new model to better understand the biology of aging in humans and primates. The study will use detailed chemical and computer- based analyses to analyze how the regulation and function of the body changes with age. The acquired knowledge has the potential to explain causes of variation in traits of aging within individuals and also differences in aging among individuals in human populations.\n",

      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Understanding how individual neurons in the mammalian central nervous system (CNS) communicate with each other requires detailed knowledge of the factors that regulate both synaptic transmission and the processing of synaptic signals by postsynaptic neurons (synaptic integration). In this project, we will address these issues by capitalizing on some key technical advantages offered by specific giant synaptic connections and postsynaptic neurons in central auditory pathways. We will study the properties of the same synapses and neurons in both normal and congenitally deaf animals, to gain insight into the role of activity in the development and regulation of synaptic strength and postsynaptic membrane properties in central pathways. Synaptic transmission and postsynaptic integration are inextricably linked - our study offers an extremely valuable opportunity to investigate both phenomena as comprehensively as possible in the same central neurons. Our aims employ patch-clamp recording of synaptic and membrane currents from calyceal axon terminals and their postsynaptic neurons, in parallel with immunolabeling and electron microscopy to localize key synaptic and membrane proteins and determine synaptic structure, and with computational methods to help understand the roles of specific ion channels in synaptic integration. The aims will test the hypotheses that altered auditory system activity during development (1) leads to changes in synaptic strength, structure, ion channel expression and neuronal excitability, and (2) disrupts the normal tonotopic organization of auditory circuits. The proposed research will use detailed, multidisciplinary approaches to study synaptic structure, function, and integration in a region of the mammalian nervous system that is highly advantageous for this purpose. The combined skills and resources of two experienced and productive laboratories will be brought to bear on these fundamental issues, which heretofore have been difficult to address in the mammalian CNS. The organization and geometry of auditory neurons and synapses allows electrophysiological and immunohistochemical results to be directly compared. The results to be obtained will be of general significance for understanding mechanisms of synaptic transmission and integration, and of clinical significance in understanding the changes that occur in the central auditory system under conditions of chronic sensory deprivation.\n",

      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Gammaherpesviruses result in lifelong infection associated with malignancies and other chronic disease in immune deficient individuals. The human gammaherpesviruses include Epstein Barr virus and Kaposi's Sarcoma associated virus, which are associated with Burkitt's lymphoma, Hodgkin's lymphoma, post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, peritoneal effusion lymphoma and Kaposi's sarcoma. Given the strict host specificity of the human gammaherpesviruses, a major challenge is to understand the host and viral factors that regulate the outcome of gammaherpesvirus infection in vivo, in both healthy and immune compromised individuals. This proposal makes extensive use of the mouse gammaherpesvirus 68, to investigate the genetic contribution of viral and host genes in shaping the outcome of infection. Through our previous work, we developed an extensive knowledge of the precise in vivo contexts in which a viral gene, the viral cyclin, promotes chronic infection. We identified seven different parameters of gammaherpesvirus infection and disease, including models of immune deficiency that are dependent on the virus encoded cyclin homolog. In this grant, we will dissect the molecular pathways used by the viral cyclin to promote infection in vivo, using recombinant viruses in which the viral cyclin has been replaced by alternate viral or cellular cyclins. We will characterize the viral cyclin activity in all cyclin dependent aspects of infection, identify the infected cell reservoir in presence and absence of the viral cyclin, and define the molecular mechanism of the viral cyclin in both persistent infection and reactivation from latency infection.These recombinant viruses reveal distinct, non-overlapping mechanisms of viral cyclin action. Moreover, since different cellular cyclins are able to substitute for distinct phases of the viral infection, comparing the biochemical properties of different cyclins in distinct contexts of infection will result in significant insights in gammaherpesvirus infection and disease. By integrating our unique in vivo insights into the viral cyclin with these recombinant viruses and our identification of the cellular target of the viral cyclin in virus reactivation, this grant wil combine biochemistry and genetics, with in vitro and in vivo models of infection to define new molecular pathways that promote gammaherpesvirus infection and pathogenesis in the whole animal. Further, we propose to test candidate inhibitors of viral cyclins and viral cyclin dependent functions both in vitro and in vivo. Finally, our demonstration that host cyclins can facilitate virus infection and that a specific host tumor suppressor can repress virus reactivationpromises that our investigation of the virus encoded cyclins will advance the field of cancer biology beyond virus associated oncogenesis. These studies of the v-cyclin have, and will continue to yield fundamental insights into gammaherpesvirus infection and further elucidate new mechanisms by which gammaherpesvirus pathogenesis can be abrogated.\n",

      "--------------------\n",
      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adult stem cells play an important role in replenishing the pool of highly differentiated but short-lived cells in different tissues. A unique feature of adult stem cells is their ability to both self-renew to maintain their population and undergo differentiation to replenish the cells of the tissue. Recent findings suggest that some cancers arise due to misregulation of mechanisms that regulate stem cells. Understanding the regulatory pathways that specify stem cell fate may thus inform new approaches for the treatment of cancer. Also, knowledge of stem cell regulation can provide strategies to manipulate adult stem cells in vivo to promote regeneration of damaged tissues. Studies have demonstrated that a key regulator of the decision between self-renewal and differentiation is the signal emanating from the niche cells surrounding the stem cells. The Drosophila male germ line is an excellent model to study interactions between the niche and stem cells in vivo. The niche signal that specifies stem cell self-renewal in the male germ line is well characterized but the downstream stem cell intrinsic regulatory pathways are unknown. The goal of this proposal is to identify cell intrinsic mechanisms that regulate male germ line stem cell behavior in response to the niche signal. The specific aims of this proposal are: 1) To examine the function of one of the genes expressed in the early germ cells, the FoxN class transcription factor, jumu, in specifying stem cell fate by loss and gain of function analysis. 2) To identify genes whose expression is directly regulated by STAT, the transcription factor activated in the stem cells in response to the niche signal, using chromatin immunoprecipitation. The function of these genes in germ line stem cells will be determined by mutational analysis.3) To identify stem cell intrinsic regulatory networks; genes expressed in the stem cell enriched population will be compared to those expressed in committed progenitor cells by microarray analysis. This will help identify mRNAs expressed in stem cells that shut down or are degraded as stem cells differentiate as well as processes that turn on as cells initiate differentiation. Relevance: The goal of this proposal is to identify mechanisms that regulate stem cell behavior in the male germ line of Drosophila; this study may provide models for the regulation of mammalian adult stem cells. Understanding stem cell regulation will be helpful in harnessing the potential of adult stem cells to regenerate damaged tissues. Also, there is evidence that some cancers arise due to defects in stem cell regulation and understanding stem cell behavior can present new strategies to treat cancer.\n",

      "--------------------\n",
      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this research is to determine how radiation therapy alters the various components of solid tumors that may affect the immune system's ability to mount effective anti-tumor responses. The goal of these studies is to gain a better understanding of the basic mechanisms involved in radiation induced changes in the tumor microenvironment to allow more effective treatment strategies combining radiation and immunotherapy. The differences in these two therapy modalities make it highly likely that their combined use could have synergistic effects on tumor destruction. Radiation is highly effective at killing large numbers of tumor cells and controlling primary disease, however, it is not easily used for the treatment of dissem- inated metastatic disease. In contrast immunotherapy, because of its specificity and systemic nature, has the potential to be less toxic to normal tissues and to reach distant metastases. However, radiation therapy may itself be damaging to critical cells of the immune system, particularly in multi-radiation dose protocols in which subsequent treatments may destroy tumor infiltrating lymphocytes. We have shown that radiation induced tumor cell death can provide increased tumor antigen to stimulate immunity, and radiation can alter the tumor vasculature making it more prone to host cell infiltration. These tumor infiltrating host cells produce many cytokines, which can stimulate changes in the tumor vasculature and tumor stroma and thus alter growth potential and radiation sensitivity. For example, we have shown that interleukin-12 (IL-12), produced within the local tumor microenvironment, causes marked changes in the tumor vasculature by preventing the upregulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor 3 leading to enhanced immune cell infiltration and delayed tumor growth or rejection. In this proposal we plan to determine the mechanisms responsible for these IL-12 induced changes in tumor vasculature and in the immune cell infiltration and function, and determine the role of interferon-gamma (IFN-g) in these processes. Due to the importance of IFN-g in these IL-12 induced changes and in alterations that render tumor cells more radioresistant, we will also determine the mechanisms by which IFN-g signally mediates radioresistance and how these affect immune sensitivity of tumors. The information we obtain will be useful in improving the combination of radiotherapy and immunotherapy to more effectively treat patients with cancer.\n",

      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Lung diseases, including lung cancer and chronic lung diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, together account for some 280,000 deaths annually (American Lung Association). Contributing to this mortality is the fact that remediation of all forms of lung disease is hampered by the limited ability of lung to regenerate. Hence, lung tissue that is damaged by degeneration or infection, or lung tissue that is surgically resected, is not functionally replaced in vivo. Currently, the only way to replace lung tissue is to perform lung transplantation, an expensive procedure that is achieves only a 10% survival at 10 years, and one that is hampered by a severe shortage of organs. Over the past 3 years, we have worked to address some fundamental challenges in lung tissue engineering. In order to produce a lung scaffold that has suitable geometry and mechanics for lung regeneration, we have developed technologies to decellularize entire lung tissues. We have shown that these acellular lung matrices retain the gross mechanical properties of the original lung tissues, and provide outstanding support for the adhesion and growth of epithelial and vascular cells. We have developed a novel,  biomimetic  bioreactor that provides for long-term sterile lung culture, circulation of nutrient medium through the lung vascular compartment, and  breathing  of nutrient medium into the airway. As a cell source to repopulate the acellular lung matrix, we have utilized syngeneic neonatal rat lung cells, as these cells show significant potential for growth inside the developing lung. We have made substantial and exciting progress in this work, and have shown the feasibility of regenerating many characteristics of lung tissue, but there remain several important issues that must be studied and addressed before the functionality of such lung tissues can be tested in vivo. Most fundamentally, in order to exchange gas, the lung must comprise sufficient alveolar diffusional surface area, must be populated with functional and differentiated epithelial cell subsets at correct anatomic locations in the alveoli and elsewhere, and must be invested with a functional microvasculature that withstands physiological perfusion pressures and does not leak fluid into the alveolar compartment. In this proposal, we will study and refine the lung tissue engineering system in order to address each of these issues and advance the central mission of functional lung regeneration, which is the capacity for effective gas exchange. We hypothesize that the acellular lung matrix, when suitably re-populated with lung epithelium and vascular cells, will support the growth and differentiation of these cells and will produce a tissue that is effective for gas exchange, based upon in vitro measurements.

      "oa cartilage knee joint osteoarthritis articular acl chondrocytes progression tissue\n",
      "--------------------\n",
      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common form of joint disease and a major cause of long-term disability in the United States (US). It is estimated that 2.5% of the adult population have symptomatic knee or hip OA. Over two-thirds of the 7.8 million OA patients in the US who seek treatment have moderate to severe joint involvement and would benefit from a therapy which arrests or delays cartilage loss. The etiology of OA is still partially unclear: While genetic factors are believed to underlie a significant proportion of OA cases, the majority of occurrences may not be genetically predetermined. OA is influenced by diet, body condition, or physical stress experienced (due to injury or overuse of a joint). Patient condition may therefore likely be improved or further progression prevented by an early identification of OA progression, combined with effective therapies. However, the current armamentarium of OA therapies merely relieves the inflammation and painful symptoms of OA but does not suppress the ongoing degenerative process. There is no known cure for osteoarthritis and further drug research is essential to help OA patients. Cartilage loss is believed to be the dominating factor in OA. While the standard radiography-based analysis method relies on joint-space width as a surrogate measure for cartilage thickness, an increasing body of literature supports the use of MRI as a primary imaging method to evaluate progression of osteoarthritis. MRI is able to directly measure cartilage volume and thickness. Being a three-dimensional imaging modality it allows, unlike x-ray projection images, for a localized analysis of imaging data in the full three-dimensional spatial context. Significant advances in MRI have resulted in the ability to quantify cartilage morphology and thereby provide a means to evaluate potential effects of pharmacologic intervention on OA progression. To aid drug development and to help subsequent regulatory approval, accurate, quantitative methods are needed to rapidly screen MR imaging data. To be time- and cost-effective, computer-assisted 3D image analysis is essential. However, most image-analysis methods for OA still require significant human intervention, precluding the comprehensive analysis of large databases as for example acquired by the Osteoarthritis Initiative. A strategy that has been beneficial in studies of the brain is the use of atlases to assist in data analysis. Following such success we propose the creation of population-based bone and cartilage atlases to facilitate bone and cartilage segmentation and to allow for localized data analysis by representing imaging data in a common anatomical coordinate system. We will use the developed methods to analyze cartilage thickness and to perform correlations with clinical variables. Developed software tools will be distributed in open-source form.\n",

      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Summary The purpose of this project is to demonstrate major improvements in care quality through redesign of care delivery in the University of Utah Community Clinics. The Community Clinics (CC) are a fee-for-service 10-site primary- and secondary-care system with about 50 primary care physicians, 350,000 annual visits, and 120,000 active patients. The CC have led primary care delivery reform since 2003 when we began the development and implementation of a new model of care called Care By Design (CBD). The three organizing principles of CBD are: Appropriate Access (AA), Care teams (CT), and Planned care (PC). It is within this existing system design that we will implement additional redesigns. In this project we will implement a comprehensive care management program targeted to patients with multiple chronic conditions. Our delivery redesign will include strategies for effectively managing care transitions and for aggressively screening for and treating depression, a complicating co-morbidity for many patients with chronic conditions. Our intervention builds upon and strengthens CBD in order to achieve major improvements in care quality. We will compare the CCs' current clinical outcomes with outcomes prior to introduction of CBD's system designs and with those achieved with our redesign components. In addition, a quasi- experimental cohort design will document improvements in clinical quality and engagement of patients and care teams as clinics enhance CBD sequentially over the three year project. Intermediate outcomes will include provider and staff use rates of EMR best practice reminders and patient and care team adherence to CER-informed guidelines. Patient engagement will be assessed by patient use of our web portal, care manager supports, and adherence to personalized care plans. We will use our EMR and CBD implementation instrument to assess staff, provider, and patient behavior, and surveys of patient activation, experience with care, and quality of life, and of provider attitudes toward patient self-management to assess quality. An important goal of our project is evaluation of the impact of our interventions and strategies on clinic ROI. We anticipate changes in volume and related revenue for ancillary tests, services, and pharmacy as we manage the care needs of our high risk patients more effectively. We will evaluate the business case for implementing currently uncompensated components of care in our fee for service environment. Additionally, by using two unique state-wide databases, we will evaluate the impact of our redesign on total cost and cost effectiveness of care by measuring emergency department visits, hospital admissions, readmissions, and associated costs of care, demonstrating the potential for decreased costs of care in the broader community. These data are key to creating a business model for sustainability of enhanced CER-informed care. Our strong interdisciplinary research team ensures successful completion of this project. The team includes developers of CBD, clinician specialists in geriatrics and pharmacy practice, members with expertise in quality improvement, biostatistics, qualitative research, behavioral sciences, and economics, and a national advisory committee that includes leading experts in practice redesign and multi-methods evaluation. Results of this project will provide practical guidance for others seeking to implement CER-informed care in primary care practices.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  This project specifically addresses the purposes of the grant program to demonstrate the feasibility and value of implementing evidence-based care improvement strategies and interventions in delivery systems as well as a number of objectives of Healthy People 2010 including improving access to comprehensive, high-quality health care services. This project implements a comprehensive program of care management for patients with multiple chronic conditions and evaluates the impact of transformation to a PCMH delivery model of primary care practices in a University network serving a broad patient population. The project addresses a broad goal for Healthy People 2010, to  Achieve access to preventive services for all Americans  by implementing best practices reminders in our EMR, pre-visit planning, and registry-based outreach.\n",

      "Ã¯Â»Â¿   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Protein synthesis is an essential metabolic process in all bacteria and a target for the development of new antibiotics. In our initially funded SCORE grant we developed an amino acylation/translation (A/T) system from P. aeruginosa based on polyU mRNA directed protein synthesis. This system was optimized and developed into a platform to perform high throughput screening of chemical compounds against the activity of the system. During this period a number of inhibitory compounds (six) were identified and characterized and developed into lead compounds. A small (5-6) congener group was built around six of the lead compounds. The goal of the current proposal is to develop a lead series around each of these lead compounds as well as to continue discovery of additional compounds that inhibit growth of pathogenic bacteria. To develop a lead series we will carry out structure activity relationship (SAR) studies to increase the inhibitory potency, solubility, ADME and abilit to inhibit biofilm formation. At the same time we will attempt to decrease the potential for drug-drug induced enzyme inhibition and toxicity to human cell lines. In the continued discovery process, we will actively recruit collaborators doing work in isolation of natural compounds to test against our system for identification of new inhibitory compounds as well as obtain small focused synthetic compound libraries. The IC50 as well as the MIC against a panel of pathogenic bacteria will initially be determined for each new inhibitor discovered. These data willdetermine if new hit compounds enter SAR studies as described above.  Next, we propose to expand the A/T minimal protein synthesis system into a more natural like protein synthesis system. During the initial grant period, we were able to accomplish much more than was proposed. We have cloned, expressed, and isolated 11 additional proteins involved in protein synthesis: seven additional aaRS proteins, three translation initiation factors (IF-1, IF-2, and IF3) and the methionyl-tRNA formyltransferase. Incorporation of these proteins into the A/T assay, along with a designer natural like mRNA, allowing translation of a short peptide will allow us to screen for inhibitors of the ribosome and 15 accessory proteins in one assay. We have functional assays developed for each component of the system and will be able to quickly determine the molecular target of an inhibitor. This system will be developed and optimized based on the experience gained in the initial funding period. Screening of compound libraries will continue to be carried out in a high throughput format using scintillation proximity assays (SPA).  Four of the lead compounds inhibit protein synthesis by inhibiting the activity of PheRS. To determine mechanism of action of these inhibitory compounds we will evaluate promising lead compounds for their ability to generate spontaneous mutants or develop resistant after serial sub-culturing of hypersensitive strains of P. aeruginosa. We will screen for mutations in the gene encoding PheRS. The structure for P. aeruginosa PheRS has been solved and we will collaborate with Dr. Kotsikorou at UTPA and use the crystal structure and molecular modeling methods to explain the effects of the mutations on resistance to the antibacterial compounds. We will also model the binding of the compounds in the active site of PheRS to better understand the mechanism of inhibitory activity.\n",

      "Title: Animal Imaging Core Recent advances in small animal imaging have substantially improved our ability to gain insights into disease progression without altering the biological systems. The small animal imaging facility at UNC currently houses nine major imaging equipments, including MRI (2), PET/CT (1), CT (1), SPECT (1), optical imaging (3), and ultrasound (1). In addition, skillful technical staff members to maintain and operate the imaging equipments and animal technicians to facilitate animal preparation for imaging and monitoring during imaging are available. Leveraging on these impressive resources, the small animal imaging (SAI) core aims to provide advanced imaging technology to facilitate the proposed projects. Specifically, two major imaging tasks will be carried out for the proposed projects, including to depict biodistribution of nanoparticles (Projects 1, 2, and 3) and to monitor and evaluate therapeutic efficacy of the proposed nanoparticles or treatment regimens (Projects 2, 3, and 4) using imaging methods. To accomplish the former task, both PET and optical imaging methods will be developed to more efficiently and accurately provide biodistribution information. For the latter task, four imaging modalities, including optical, CT, PET, and MRI will be used to monitor therapeutic efficacy. Finally, while the imaging capability in the small animal imaging facility is already impressive, our institution has committed additional funds to further augment the imaging program at UNC, including the establishment of an on-site cyclotron facility and the associated radiochemistry lab and the development of imaging registration approaches for multimodality imaging using microCT, MRI, and PET (Projects 2, 3 and 4). Together, we believe that the available technical expertise and well established infrastructure in the small animal imaging facility will greatly facilitate the success ofthe proposed projects.\n",

      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Type 2 diabetes is characterized by insulin resistance and disordered beta-cell function, especially a defect in glucose-stimulated insulin-secretion. Insulin receptors and signaling proteins are found within the beta-cells themselves. Recent evidence in rodents suggests the insulin signaling pathway is functional in islets and is important for glucose sensing. The physiologic role of insulin signaling within beta-cells in humans remains unknown. Our preliminary studies demonstrate that in healthy humans beta-cells are insulin sensitive tissues and raising circulating insulin levels by exogenous insulin administration can enhance glucose induced insulin secretion. We hypothesize that dysfunctional insulin signaling, i.e. insulin resistance, at the level of the beta-cell may be one mechanism underlying blunted insulin secretion in persons with type 2 diabetes and insulin resistant syndromes, which would be manifest as reduced insulin potentiation of glucose induced insulin secretion. We propose to further our understanding of insulin's effects on the beta-cell in healthy persons and to determine whether insulin potentiation of glucose induced insulin secretion is blunted in persons with type 2 diabetes. We demonstrate insulin potentiates glucose induced insulin secretion in the setting of suppression of circulating FFA. Several studies suggest an essential role for FFA in both basal and glucose stimulated insulin secretion, while other studies suggest that excess FFA are lipotoxic to the a-cell. To test whether replacement of FFA will enhance insulin potentiation of glucose induced insulin secretion, or whether the response is secondary to the suppression of circulating FFA, we will evaluate the role of free fatty acids in insulin potentiation of glucose induced insulin production. We demonstrate a marked increase in glucose disposal rates with dextrose administration following insulin pre-exposure. We will evaluate whether this occurs within hepatic or muscle tissues using positron emission tomography imaging. To better understand the molecular pathways underlying these processes, mechanistic studies will be conducted in control and insulin receptor deficient islets, in vitro. These studies may provide a unifying explanation linking the combined defects in insulin secretion and action that underlie type 2 diabetes.\n",

      "The number of people directly affected by diabetes continues to grow. In Washington State, 350,000 people are living with diabetes; another 150,000 are living with diabetes but have not been diagnosed. Some people in our state are affected by diabetes more than others. People with lower incomes and education levels are at greater risk to develop diabetes. These same individuals often do not have access to the diabetes education and health care needed to manage diabetes and prevent the complications often caused by uncontrolled diabetes. Research shows that treatments available today dramatically improve the management of diabetes and prevent long-term complications. The WSU Diabetes Awareness and Detection project has shown improvements in participants' knowledge and confidence to manage their diabetes and improvements in diabetes control as measured by A1c and blood pressure. The WSU Diabetes Detection and Prevention project will continue to offer diabetes awareness education classes in eight counties reaching three hundred individuals with diabetes in communities with high rates of diabetes. Medications are an important part of diabetes care.  But medications only work if people take them. , as stated by Robin Rubin PhD. People living with diabetes often have difficulty managing their medication plan. Initial results from On the Road to Living Well with Diabetes (OTR) program shows participants who report taking medications as prescribed have better management of their diabetes, measured by A1c and blood pressure. The WSU Diabetes Awareness and Detection project will work with Joslin Diabetes Center to explore ways to improve individuals' ability to comply with medication plan. The effectiveness of an educational booklet and lesson on medication adherence will be evaluated with 100 participants, in the OTR program. In Washington State 1.4 million people are affected by pre-diabetes. While education and management of diabetes helps reduce the burden of diabetes, the best way to reduce the impact of diabetes is to prevent pre-diabetes from developing into diabetes. Pre-diabetes is prevented by increasing physical activity and healthy food choices. In Washington, thirty-eight percent of the population does not meet the CDC recommendations for physical activity. Populations with lower education and income levels are less likely to attain the recommended levels of activity. Promoting physical activity at the community level has reduced the risks for developing diabetes and cardiovascular disease. The WSU Diabetes Detection and Prevention project will promote a community based walking challenge in eight counties to encourage regular activity; encourage families to exercise together, and to eat healthier foods. Communities across Washington are taking action to make it easier for residents to eat healthy and be more active. Individuals and organizations from a variety of backgrounds are working together to make healthier communities. WSU Extension is an important partner in this work and will continue to participate and promote Diabetes Awareness and Detection as a vital part of these efforts in five counties across the state.\n",

      "--------------------\n",
      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Circadian rhythms, roughly 24-hour rhythms in physiology and behavior, are widespread in nature and can be found in many plants and animals. Disruption of circadian rhythms has been linked to human health disorders ranging from jet lag to sleep and mood disorders and even to cancer. In eukaryotes, the circadian clocks that drive these rhythms are composed of networks of interlocked transcriptional feedback loops, in which positive factors induce the expression of negative factors that in turn repress expression of the positive factors. Although individual clock components are not conserved across kingdoms, clear analogies can be drawn between the organization of the circadian system and the `wiring' of the central clock, or oscillator, between disparate organisms. A fundamental understanding of how the circadian clock works in a variety of model systems will lead to new insights into the functioning of the human circadian system and its role in human health and disease. The long-term goal of the proposed research is to better understand the molecular basis of circadian rhythms in eukaryotes. These studies will be performed in Arabidopsis thaliana, a model organism with extensive genetic and genomic resources that is well-suited to circadian research. Some predicted components of the Arabidopsis central clock have not yet been identified, the biochemical functions of many known clock genes have not been determined, and it is not understood how the clock regulates growth and development. The proposed studies will use genetic, genomic, and biochemical techniques to address these fundamental questions. First, the molecular function of a clock-associated protein that is highly conserved across eukaryotes will be determined by a combination of genetic and biochemical studies in Arabidopsis and fission yeast. Second, a gene that acts close to the central clock will be cloned and characterized. Finally, the targets of a clock-regulated transcription factor that modulates the central clock and regulates organ size will be identified. These studies will yield important insights into the workings of the circadian clock and how it regulates growth and development in a complex eukaryote, information that ultimately may be used to improve human health through treatment of circadian disorders. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Almost all organisms possess an internal clock that generates roughly 24-hour rhythms in physiology or behavior. Disruption of this circadian clock in humans has serious negative consequences, causing sleep and mood disorders and perhaps even contributing to diseases such as cancer. To better understand the molecular basis of circadian rhythms, we are carrying out extensive genetic, biochemical, and genomic studies on the model organism Arabidopsis thaliana.\n",

The Center will conduct interdisciplinary, community-based minority health and health disparities research by studying the pathways to disparities in health outcomes with an emphasis on familial factors, acculturation, and gender. The Southwest Interdisciplinary Research Center's (SIRC) provides the foundation upon which the new center on health disparities will be established. Founding the Exploratory Center will strengthen Arizona State University's (ASU) capacity as a national leader in the U.S.-Mexico border region to advance health disparities research and make a significant contribution to advancing DHHS' initiatives for eliminating health disparities in the Southwest. The proposed center's mission is to produce and apply scientific findings leading to the improvement of minority health and the reduction of health disparities by advocating the unfettered access to culturally competent health/behavioral health prevention, services, and treatment for minority populations. The Exploratory Center expands health disparities research from proximal causes of morbidity and mortality to fundamental causes of disease and related cultural processes which act as protective or risk factors. This will be achieved by identifying and ameliorating the pernicious constraints that emerge from the interaction of poverty, language barriers, race, ethnicity, gender, and cultural norms within unresponsive systems of care. The center's research projects and its administrative, research, training and community engagement/outreach cores aim to prevent, reduce and eliminate health disparities within the following DHHS identified special emphasis areas and determinants: HIV/AIDS, mental health, and substance abuse. The three focus areas will be studied throughout the prevention-to-services continuum with a special emphasis on understanding their comorbidity and their effect on the health outcomes of the historical ethnic communities of the Southwest (Mexican Americans & American Indians) and two fast growing racial minority populations in the region, African Americans and Asian Americans.\n",

      "Project 3: Psychosis Abstract:A more severe phenotype of Alzheimer disease (AD) is identified by theoccurrence of psychosis. AD with psychosis (AD+P) is common, with a cumulative incidence of ~ 40%-60% insubjects with AD. AD+P subjects have more rapid cognitive decline, increased disability, and greater mortalitythan AD subjects without psychosis (AD-P). Current empiric treatments for psychosis in AD have limitedefficacy and are associated with substantial toxicity, motivating efforts to identify the underlying neurobiology ofAD+P. We have assembled a large brain tissue collection of AD cases characterized antemortem forpsychosis, placing us in a unique position to address this need. This project will test our overarching model thatAD+P results from specific biologic processes that modify AD-related neurodegeneration, yielding more rapidcognitive decline and psychotic symptoms. This model initially derived from our observation that theoccurrence of psychosis in AD is familial, a finding which has since been replicated in two independentcohorts. Brain imaging and neuropathologic studies provide further evidence of a characteristic neurobiology ofAD+P, with exaggerated reductions of gray matter volume, blood flow, glucose metabolism, and increasedphosphotau (pTau) burden in multiple neocortical regions. Additional AD+P risk may also result from comorbidneocortical stage Lewy body pathology. Nevertheless, in our preliminary data, after accounting for all of thesepathologies, unexplained causation of psychosis in AD remains. The more rapid cognitive decline in AD+P,and observations that synapse loss is the strongest correlate of cognitive impairment, suggest that synapticdysfunction and loss is one source of the missing neuropathology in AD+P. Additionally, recent geneticstudies have highlighted inflammation as having a more central role in AD neurodegeneration than previouslyappreciated, and inflammation, especially when affecting synaptic proteins, is strongly associated withpsychosis. We therefore propose a set of specific aims designed to determine the proportion of AD+Pexplained by these pathologies: 1) To quantify the burden of AD and comorbid neuropathologies withinneocortical regions in AD+P and AD-P subjects; 2) To evaluate markers of synaptic dysfunction and loss inAD+P; 3) To evaluate markers of inflammation in AD+P. Combining a Sr. Investigator (Sweet) with expertise inthe synaptic pathology of psychosis and a Jr. Investigator (Kofler) with expertise in the neuropathology andimmunology of AD provides strong scientific synergy, increased likelihood of success, and an opportunity forcareer development. Completion of these aims will provide the necessary basis for future mechanistic studiesassessing whether interventions to alter affected pathways (pTau, synaptic signaling & inflammatory) may slowsynaptic impairment and cognitive decline downstream of AÃÂ¿ in model systems. In addition, our findings willinform how much each pathologic process contributes to AD+P risk, and allow evaluation of whether thatweighting differs across individuals, which could be important for future efforts at personalized therapeutics.\n",

      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Stress is a powerful stimulus that modulates animal behavior and the functioning of the nervous system. In people, stress negatively impacts a variety of psychiatric conditions relevant to the clinical mission of the Department of Veterans Affairs, including depression, anxiety and substance abuse. In particular, exposure to severe stress is associated with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), both in military and civilian populations. These conditions are a major health issue for our veteran population and available treatments are at best partially effective. There is a pressing need to better understand the effect of stress on the functioning of the brain in order to design better treatments for stress related disorders. Studies in humans and animals have indicated that the amygdala is a brain region involved in mediating the behavioral responses to stress, and patients' with PTSD show elevated activity in this brain region. In particular the basolateral complex of the amygdala (BLA) is critical to normal and pathological amygdala functioning. The BLA's response to stress has been shown to involve synaptic plasticity of the excitatory, glutamatergic connections within this brain region. While complex synaptic plasticity is a complex phenomenon, many studies have indicated that it involves the NMDA and AMPA subtypes of glutamate receptor, as well as the signal transduction protein CaMKII. Manipulations that block the activity of these proteins block behavioral responses to stress. There is evidence that the response of these proteins to altered activity levels and stress involves altered patterns of localization. It is the goal of this proposal to study this issue in more detail using immunohistochemical localization of the NR1 and GluR1 subunits of the NMDA and AMPA receptors and CaMKII and high resolution electron microscopic examination. We will use a rodent model of repeated, severe stress- repeated immobilization stress to study the effect of stress in the BLA. We will begin by determining the time course of how stress alters the localization of these proteins in the BLA. We will next use an in vitro system to assess how these proteins are affected by altered activity patterns in the BLA and how prior stress exposure modifies the amygdala's response to activity. Finally, we will use post-embedding immunogold labeling to study how stress affects the composition of the postsynaptic density in the BLA.  These studies will provide a detailed understanding of the molecular architecture of excitatory neurotransmission in the BLA and determine how this is altered by prior stress exposure. This information will enhance our understanding of stress affects in this critical brain region and suggest possible molecular targets for novel therapies for stress related disorders, including PTSD.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     Stress plays a significant role in modifying behavior and may lead to, or worsen, a variety of psychiatric conditions relevant to the clinical mission of the Department of Veterans Affairs.  Stress can precipitate or worsen episodes of depression and a variety of different anxiety disorders.  Stress is associated with worsening symptoms in schizophrenia.  Stress is associated with relapse in alcohol and drug abuse and dependence.  In particular, we now recognize that severe stressors can be associated with the development of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in both civilian and military populations.  These conditions afflict large numbers of our veteran population.  Substantial resources have been committed to the care of these patients, and further, these disorders can increase a patient's use of healthcare resources for other medical problems.  While importance of stress and stress related illnesses is clearly established, our treatments remain partially effective at best.  Here we propose research to better understand the effect of stress in a critical brain region, the amygdala.  The amygdala is a brain region involved in PTSD and the brain's response to stress.  Stress has been shown to alter the circuitry and functioning of the amygdala.  In this proposal we will investigate how the organization of key molecules, involved in excitatory communication in the amgygdala, is altered by stress.  The results of the proposed studies will further our understanding of stress induced changes in the amygdala and suggest specific molecular targets for new drug treatments for stress related disorders, including PTSD.\n",

      "--------------------\n",
      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The loss of skeletal muscle mass is of clinical importance because it is associated with increased morbidity and mortality, as well as a marked deterioration in the quality of life. A broad patient population is affected by significant losses in muscle mass including those afflicted by various systemic diseases (cancer, sepsis, HIV- AIDS), chronic physical inactivity as a result of long term bed rest, rheumatoid arthritis and limb immobilization, and sarcopenia, the age associated loss in muscle mass and strength. Satellite cells are currently an attractive therapeutic target given their stem cell characteristics and essential role in post-natal muscle growth and regeneration. What remains controversial is the necessity of satellite cells in other aspects of muscle plasticity such as hypertrophy, re-growth following atrophy and muscle maintenance with aging. In an effort to resolve this fundamental issue, a novel mouse line was created which enables the specific ablation of satellite cells in mature skeletal muscle. The Pax7-DTA mouse will be used to investigate the physiological function of satellite cells in skeletal muscle hypertrophy (Aim 1) and re-growth following muscle atrophy (Aim 2). The results from the proposed experiments are expected to provide fundamental knowledge on the function of satellite cells in adult skeletal muscle plasticity which will help define the therapeutic value of satellite cells in treating the loss of muscle mass in various clinical conditions.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Loss of muscle, a common symptom associated with many chronic diseases, physical inactivity or aging, negatively impacts a person's quality of life, increases the susceptibility to other complications of disease and can even lead to death. Treatments designed to restore or prevent muscle loss have in part focused on using muscle stem cells referred to as satellite cells. The goal of the proposed research is to determine if satellite cells are necessary for adult muscle growth and thus, are an appropriate target for therapy for skeletal muscle loss.\n",

      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic nonmalignant pain is highly prevalent, and is associated with substantial personal suffering, lost productivity, and healthcare costs. Use of opioid analgesics for management of nonmalignant chronic pain has increased dramatically, yet is fraught with controversy due to associated side effects and abuse potential. Moreover, the analgesic efficacy of opioid analgesics can vary widely between individuals. Given the increasing use of opioid analgesics for the management of chronic pain, we aim in this project to improve understanding of factors that influence opioid analgesic effectiveness, and which may have relevance to understanding opioid risks. Possible predictors of individual differences in responses to opioid analgesics include traits of negative affect and emotion regulation, sex, experimental acute pain sensitivity, circulating levels of the endogenous opioid agonist beta-endorphin (BE), and efficiency of conditioned pain modulation (CPM). A common mechanism that may explain how these diverse factors could all predict opioid analgesic responses is endogenous opioid system function. We propose that traits of negative affect and emotion regulation, sex, acute pain sensitivity, plasma BE levels, and CPM may reveal direct effects on opioid analgesic responses, but may also exert influence indirectly via associations with functioning of endogenous opioid antinociceptive systems. We will use controlled laboratory methods to assess acute pain responses in 120 chronic low back pain (LBP) patients and 120 healthy controls across three sessions using a randomized, counterbalanced design: under placebo, opioid blockade (naloxone), and opioid agonist (morphine). Aim1 is to determine the degree to which an index of endogenous opioid function (opioid blockade effects on pain responses) is related to exogenous opioid analgesic effects, and to compare these associations in LBP patients to those shown in healthy people. This will be an innovative test of the hypothesis that better endogenous opioid function (larger opioid blockade effects) predict greater exogenous opioid analgesia. Aim 2 is to determine: a) the degree to which negative affect and emotion regulation traits, sex, acute pain sensitivity, resting plasma BE levels, and CPM are related to exogenous opioid analgesic effects (total effect); and b) the degree to which these factors are related indirectly to exogenous opioid analgesic effects via differences in endogenous opioid function (blockade effects) (mediation). Aim 3 will explore relationships among opioid side effects, indicators of opioid abuse potential, opioid analgesic efficacy, and endogenous opioid function. Results could improve not only theoretical understanding of how these potential markers for poor opioid analgesic response may operate directly versus through a common endogenous opioid mechanism, but eventually permit clinical characterization of likely costs/benefits of opioid-based pain management a priori for a given patient. In addition, results may suggest interventions that could directly target common pain modulatory mechanisms underlying these predictive factors.\n",

The liver's extraordinary regenerative capacity is critical to understanding the mechanisms leading to developmental defects, acute and chronic liver diseases, and liver carcinogenesis. Stimulation of hepatocyte proliferation while preventing apoptosis is essential to the liver's regenerative process. Recently we uncovered a tumor suppressor pathway has potent effects upon liver cell division and death. Our long range goal is to define the cellular mechanisms underlying liver regeneration in health and disease and to apply these findings to developing improved therapies for liver disease. To that end, we are uniquely capable to address the objectives of this application, which are to uncover the mechanism that leads to the novel tumor suppressors' profound effects upon the liver. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that: The tumor suppressor controls liver celgrowth factor pathway in controlling liver size. At the end of the study we will better understand the growth and death of liver cells. This will help develop treatment for many liver diseases such as liver transplantation, cirrhosis, acute and chronic hepatitis.     Project Narrative: The objectives of this study are to uncover a newly recognized very potent molecular system that controls the growth and death of the liver cells. Unlocking how this pathway works will help develop treatment for many liver diseases such as liver transplantation, cirrhosis, acute and chronic hepatitis.\n",

By studying benign breast disease we can examine an earlier period in the disease process. This proposal aims to examine a full spectrum of stages on the pathway to breast cancer in Nurses' Health Study I and II: 1) early stages by focusing on the relationship between adolescent diet and incidence of proliferative breast disease; 2) intermediate and cumulative lifetime exposures by concentrating on genetic and molecular predictors of proliferative breast disease; and 3) later stages by examining protein expression in benign breast tissue and subsequent breast cancer risk. Specifically, we hypothesize that adolescent intake of total and specific subtypes of fat are associated with proliferative breast disease; polymorphisms and haplotypes in the insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I pathway and the progesterone receptor, as well as circulating levels of IGF-1 and IGFBP-3, are related to incidence of proliferative benign breast disease; expression of molecular markers (ER-a, PR, IGF-1 R, Ki67 and cytokeratin 5/6) in benign breast disease tissue is associated with subsequent risk of breast cancer. This study offers a unique opportunity to prospectively examine adolescent diet and molecular markers in relation to proliferative breast disease. Additional follow-up of the breast cancer nested case-control data set will allow us to examine in more detail the relationship between proliferative breast disease and subsequent breast cancer. The creation of tissue microarrays using benign breast tissue will lay the foundation for this and future studies to efficiently examine the role of molecular markers in the development of breast cancer.\n",

      "NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY Remarkable levels of sophistication have been reached in linking properties of a given material to its microstructure, crystal structure and electronic structure. A substantially bigger challenge, though, is predicting the dynamic evolution of a material taken out of equilibrium and determining what external stimuli must be imposed to shepherd the material into a desired end state. The desirable properties from a particular chemistry are usually manifested in metastable crystal structures and microstructures rather than in the true equilibrium state of that chemistry. In many applications it is necessary to know how a material in a particular state will evolve over time either because it is metastable or unstable, such as in high temperature applications, or due to changing boundary conditions, as in electrochemical energy storage applications.This award supports computational research and education to develop highly automated statistical mechanical software tools that will be used to predict materials properties and greatly enhance the ability to design materials for high temperature and non-equilibrium applications from first principles. Areas where such tools will prove invaluable include the design of new (i) structural materials for aerospace applications and large-scale power generation plants, (ii) electrode and electrolyte materials for electrochemical energy storage, (iii) materials for thermoelectric applications and (iv) materials for shape memory applications. The project will also involve the education and training of graduate students in computational materials science, a field that is increasingly recognized as invaluable in the design and rapid implementation of new materials.TECHNICAL SUMMARY  This award supports research and educational activities aimed at extending the existing thermodynamic and kinetic foundations that underpin phenomenological descriptions of non-equilibrium processes in the solid state. This will be realized by two activities: (i) the development of statistical mechanical computational tools to automate the calculation of a wide variety of thermodynamic and kinetic properties that are essential in the description of materials evolving out of equilibrium and (ii) the development and application of new statistical mechanical theoretical methods to enable the prediction of high temperature properties of multi-component crystalline solids. A deep understanding of many high temperature materials and non-equilibrium processes is hampered by a lack of not only quantitative thermodynamic, kinetic and mechanical data, but also a lack of knowledge about qualitative trends in this data. Furthermore, a large class of technologically important high temperature materials cannot be adequately described and understood with current statistical mechanical methods. This research activity will result in highly automated computational statistical mechanical tools to predict free energies and transport coefficients as a function of concentration. Such tools will provide new knowledge about the dependence of a wide variety of materials properties on chemistry and crystal structure. The theoretical focus on high temperature phases will generate fundamental new insights about the vibrational stabilization mechanisms, atomic hop mechanisms and mechanical properties of a large and important class of poorly understood materials used in high temperature applications.  The project will also involve the education and training of graduate students in computational materials science, a field that is increasingly recognized as invaluable in the design and rapid implementation of new materials.\n",

The primary aims are to: (a) determine if the intervention, compared to an attention control condition, improves behavioral adherence to the diabetes self-management regimen including: dietary adherence, as measured by dietary recalls and analyzed using the Nutrient Data System; physical activity as reported by self report using the CHAMPS Physical Activity Questionnaire and pedometer readings; adherence to capillary glucose self-monitoring as assessed by the ACCU-CHECK monitor, and adherence to medication management as determined by medication refill rates, (b) determine whether the intervention improves clinical outcome measures including: HbAlc, weight loss, and anthropometrics, (c) explore the extent to which self-efficacy is a mediator of adherence, (d) explore the extent to which the effectiveness of the intervention varies with respect to glycemic control and nephrovascular complications at baseline, and (e) explore the impact of a variety of covariates (medications, depression, social support, severity of disease, and general health and sociodemographic characteristics, and clinic from which they were recruited) on the effectiveness of the intervention. Hypothesis #1 is that intervention group participants will perform better than attention control group participants on various measures of adherence to the diabetes management regimen. Primary adherence variables will be dietary intake, and physical activity. Hypothesis #2 is that intervention group participants will have lower HbAlc levels than attention control group participants. The 6-month intervention will focus on building a sense of mastery over the following components of the regimen: glucose self-monitoring, medication self-management, diet, and physical activity. The intervention will include group classes and individual counseling. The intervention participants will be compared to an attention control group exposed to seminars and newsletters. Measurements will occur at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months.\n",

      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic alcohol causes widespread changes in brain gene expression in humans and animal models, some of which contribute to alcohol addiction and alcohol dependence. Recent studies point to a central role of chromatin modifications, often referred to as epigenetic changes, in controlling alcohol- induced changes in gene expression and behavior. To understand how chromatin modifications mediate changes in gene expression in alcoholic brain, an integration of chromatin and transcriptional data at the genome level is required. Here we will test the hypothesis that chronic alcohol abuse changes gene expression via long-lasting changes in chromatin states. We will first measure genomic differences at two chromatin marks in postmortem brains of chronic alcoholics and control cases using chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by DNA sequencing (ChIP-Seq). We will then explore the genome-wide relationships between chromatin modifications and gene expression measured in the same samples by RNA-Seq using a novel systems approach. This approach will allow us to partition genomic variance into biologically meaningful patterns and identify robust correlations between ChIP- Seq and RNA-Seq data sets, which we will use to propose mechanistic links between chromatin marks and gene expression. This approach will also prioritize individual genes based on their importance in gene networks and correlations with chromatin marks and we will use this strategy to select several hub genes for validation. We will validate chromatin marks of several hub genes with ChIP followed by qRT- PCR and their expression levels with qRT-PCR. Overall, this proposal aims to develop a systems approach that will detect robust co-variation between ChIP-Seq and RNA-Seq data sets. We will identify epigenetic components critical for regulation of gene expression by chronic alcohol abuse and provide new targets for medication development for human alcoholism. In addition, this approach may serve as a prototype for analysis of the wealth of existing and emerging genomic data.\n",

Proposal Number: 1403086Institution: SUNY at BuffaloTitle: Cell-cell adhesion and stem cell fate commitmentMesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have significant potential as a cell source for cellular therapies. Although the role of many soluble factors and extracellular matrix molecules in MSC differentiation has been examined, the role of cell-cell interactions remains unexplored. This project is based on an innovative research plan to understand the role of cell-cell interactions in stem cell differentiation and to develop novel strategies to tune stem cell fate decisions by controlling the extent of cell-to-cell adhesion.  In addition to addressing basic scientific questions, the proposed work will enable design of strategies, biomaterials and devices to control stem cell differentiation with applications in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine and potentially also to cancer.  The proposed research will be integrated with educational and outreach activities involving high school students, undergraduate students with emphasis on students from underrepresented minorities, and will incorporate research findings in coursework curricula and in distance-learning modules in a program established by the Department of Biomedical Engineering at the University at Buffalo to provide the New York State industry and graduate students with advanced engineering instruction.The goal of the proposed work is to employ novel engineering technologies and a multi-prong strategy to improve the understanding of the role of cell-to-cell adhesion in stem cell fate decisions. Differentiation of MSCs is affected by many soluble and insoluble signals in the local microenvironment. In addition to soluble growth factors, cell-extracellular matrix interactions and substrate mechanics have been implicated in stem cell lineage commitment. However, the mechanical and biochemical signals originating from cell-to-cell adhesion remain unexplored in this context. Recent studies implicated adherens junctions in the maintenance of embryonic stem cell self-renewal potential and during cellular reprogramming, but the role of cell-cell interactions in MSC differentiation remains elusive. Therefore, the overarching hypothesis of the proposed work is that cell-to-cell adhesion affects stem cell fate decisions.  This hypothesis will be addressed by a series of mechanistic studies to understand the role of Cadherin-11 on MSC differentiation into smooth muscle cells.  Methods to be employed include novel microfabrication technologies to control the extent of cell-cell interactions, and the novel lentiviral array (LVA) technology developed in the PI's laboratory to monitor in real time multiple genes and pathways during MSC differentiation.  The proposed work represents a significant step forward in understanding the role of cell-to-cell adhesion in stem cell differentiation and will enable design of strategies, biomaterials and devices for applications in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. Finally, although the proposed work will focus on MSCs, the research findings are expected to impact other types of stem cells, such as cancer stem cells, where intercellular interactions may also play an important role.\n",

      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of the proposed epidemiologic study is to examine the causes and consequences of impaired decision-making in old age. Decision-making refers to the ability to generate and process multiple competing alternatives and choose a favorable behavior. Virtually all behaviors result from some decision-making process, and efficient decision-making is thought to be critical for maintaining independence, health and well-being in modern society. Emerging data suggest that older persons, even some without dementia, exhibit impaired decision-making, and impaired decision-making may be a sign of preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, surprisingly few studies have rigorously examined decision-making in older persons and longitudinal data are sorely lacking. The proposed study will quantify the rate of change in financial, healthcare, and socioemotional decision-making in a large cohort of community-based older persons without dementia and test the hypothesis that impaired decision-making is associated with adverse health outcomes (i.e., decreased well-being, disability, nursinghome placement, dementia, and death). Further, we will examine the role of affective and contextual factors in decision-making and test the hypothesis that select affective and contextual factors can sustain decision-making even in the face of cognitive decline. Finally, in an effort to understand the neurobiologic basis of impaired decision-making, we will test the hypothesis that AD pathology contributes to impaired decision-making in older persons without dementia who come to autopsy. The proposed study will capitalize on the unique infrastructure provided by the Rush Memory and Aging Project (R01AG17917), a large ongoing epidemiologic clinical-pathologic study of aging and AD, and will quantify decision-making and new pathologic indices in more than 800 community-based participants without dementia; all have agreed to detailed annual clinical evaluations including cognitive assessments and brain donation. By linking the newly collected data on decision-making and AD pathology in brain regions that subserve decision-making with the available data from the Memory and Aging Project, we will have an unprecedented opportunity to examine the causes and consequences of impaired decision-making in old age. Knowledge of the causes and consequences of impaired decision-making is essential for the development of effective interventions to promote independence, health, and well-being in old age.\n",

      "Crucial components of environmental data analysis are exposure assessment and the relationship between exposure and a health outcome. Investigators often go to great lengths to obtain careful, detailed measures of exposure, which may have multiple constituents, change over time, and be modified by personal factors. Investigators often replace this multivariate exposure data with simple summary statistics (e.g., cumulative or average exposures in some time window of interest) for analysis, which may or may not be the aspects of exposure most closely related to health outcomes of interest. Indeed, to assess the association between an individual&rsquo;s exposure history and a health event, it is preferable (and often necessary) to reduce the dimensionality of the exposure history data to calculate aggregate and cumulative exposure effects. Some examples include exposure to drinking water disinfection by-products (DBPs), occupational exposures to agricultural chemicals, and exposures to air pollutants. The primary objectives of this research are to develop useful methods for summarizing complex exposures and for examining the relationship between the exposures and health outcomes, to account properly for resultant uncertainty in the exposure assessment, and to use the models for estimation, prediction, and other inferences about the effects of multi-chemical, multi-pathway exposures.\n",

      "Ã¯Â»Â¿   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Prostate cancer is a heterogeneous disease with significant variations in its clinical outcome. Current methods to assess prostate cancer risk combine prostate specific antigen (PSA) screening and random prostate biopsy. Unfortunately, this strategy fails to reveal the lesion's location and does not accurately differentiate between aggressive and non-aggressive prostate cancers. As a result, most patients will receive unnecessary active treatment for low-risk prostate cancer in order to avoid under treatment. Active treatment involves surgery or radiation, often causing long-term side effects such as urinary incontinence, erectile dysfunction, or bowel urgency. Therefore, non-invasive and accurate diagnostic methods to determine the location of prostate cancer and to assess its immediate risk are needed.  The mission of Prostate Theranostics is to address this problem by developing targeting MRI contrast enhancing agents specific to an extracellular matrix (ECM) protein, oncofetal fibronectin (onfFN), for early accurate detection of prostate cancer. These agents would also be fitted with Gd(III)-chelates that would allow their location to be visualized within men's prostates using MRI. MRI is a non-invasive clinical diagnostic technique and can provide three-dimensional images of whole prostate with a resolution as high as 100 ÃÂµm. Recent studies show that the over expression of extracellular matrix proteins within prostate tissue are correlated to prostate cancer aggressiveness. In addition, these proteins can be targeted using specific peptide sequences. This project proposes to develop MRI contrast-enhancing agents with specific peptide sequences. These targeting probes would then bind to aggressive prostate cancer after intravenous injection. In addition, the clinician would be able tovisualize location of human prostate cancer using MRI.  The objectives of this SBIR Phase I project are to further optimize the targeted contrast-enhancing agent and commercialize the agent for clinical imaging prostate cancer. Non-invasive accurate detection of prostate cancer is an unmet clinical need for prostate cancer management. Successful development of our imaging technology has the potential to accurately detect and diagnose prostate cancer, replace invasive prostate biopsy, and improve decision-making in clinical management of prostate cancer. It also has the potential for non-invasive active surveillance of prostate cancer and timely monitoring of disease progression, as well as image-guided surgery and therapy.\n",

      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Maintaining healthy cognitive functions, of which memory is a most important one, is one of the major goals of mental health research. Aging, diseases, stress and injury can lead to cognitive and memory impairments. It is estimated that up to one third of adults will experience a gradual decline in cognitive function known as mild cognitive impairment as they age. Furthermore, risk for Alzheimer<s disease, memory loss and dementia increases with increasing age. Thus, minimizing or preventing cognitive and memory loss is very important as the average life span continues to lengthen. It is therefore imperative to understand the physiology of memory formation, persistence and storage and identify molecular mechanisms and targets that are associated with memory impairments in order to develop strategies that will prevent or reverse them. Newly learned information is in a labile state for a limited time and becomes a long-term memory through a process of stabilization that is known as memory consolidation. Once stable, memory can become labile again if retrieved and re-stabilizes through another process known as memory reconsolidation. Using contextual fear conditioning types of memory in rats, we have recently found that the growth factor insulin like growth factor II (IGF-II) acts as a potent memory enhancer when administered during the consolidation or reconsolidation phases. Furthermore, using inhibitory avoidance (IA), we have found that retrieval-dependent reconsolidation promotes memory strengthening and prevents forgetting. These findings suggest that it is possible to identify post-retrieval mechanisms that can be used as targets to develop new therapies that promote cognition and alleviate age- related memory decline. Using IA and social transmission of food preference in rats, this proposal will test the molecular mechanisms and brain circuitry of the retrieval-dependent IGF-II-induced memory enhancement. It will investigate circuitry and molecular mechanisms of retrieval-induced memory strengthening and prevention of forgetting. Finally, it will investigate how memory retrieval and IGF-II can be used in aging to delay or reverse memory impairments. Results from these studies will advance our knowledge of neural mechanisms underlying memory enhancement and aging-related cognitive impairment in rats.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Capitalizing on recent findings from our ongoing project using the rat as an animal model, this project continuation aims at identifying the mechanisms and circuitry of memory enhancement in adult animals and in preventing or rescuing memory decay. The results of these studies may lead to the identification of new therapies that prevent or reverse memory impairments. Preventing or rescuing cognitive and memory loss is a most important goal in mental health research.\n",

The latter results will target enrollment of high-risk subjects into future treatment trials and increase application of available preventive therapies. Hypertension treatment has been the most effective intervention altering the course of renal function loss in CKD.

      "--------------------\n",
      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Imbalances in neurohumoral control, especially those leading to excessive sympathetic efferent neuronal activation, are associated with adverse short- and long-term alterations in cardiac function - including cardiac arrhythmias and pump failure. As a corollary, stabilization of such imbalances within select components of the cardiac neuronal hierarchy can reduce the arrhythmic substrate, maintain myocyte viability and prolong survival. Thus, the primary objective for this competitive renewal is to first determine the role of interdependent interactions within and between central and peripheral components of the cardiac neuronal hierarchy and secondly how such linkages remodel in response to acute and chronic cardiac stress (e.g. myocardial ischemia/infarction). As the intrinsic cardiac nervous system represents the final common integrator of cardiac control, this organ component of the cardiac neuronal hierarchy represents a primary focus for targeted neuromodulation therapy. We hypothesize that chronic myocardial infarction/ischemia remodels the peripheral (intrinsic cardiac and extra cardiac intrathoracic) nervous system, thereby contributing to both the genesis of cardiac arrhythmias and deterioration of contractile function. We further hypothesize that targeted neuromodulation mitigates ischemia-induced remodeling of the intrinsic cardiac and extra cardiac intrathoracic nervous systems, thereby reducing the substrate for cardiac arrhythmia formation while sustaining contractile function. This grant exploits the opportunities afforded by electrical neuromodulation via spinal cord stimulation (SCS), a clinical therapy with recognized anti-antiginal properties - a therapeutic approach that has potential for management of both i) arrhythmias and ii) congestive heart failure. Central nexus points within the cardiac neuronal hierarchy will be stimulated electrically (dorsal T1-T3 SCS) to modulate the intrinsic cardiac nervous system to impact regional cardiac electrical stability and support contractile function. Specific aim 1 will determine a) how regional atrial electrical events are coordinated by the intrinsic cardiac neuronal activity such that excessive activation of its select nerve inputs lead to atrial arrhythmias and b) if chronic SCS modifies cholinergic and noncholinergic synaptic interactions within the intrinsic cardiac nervous system to reduce this arrhythmogenic potential. Specific aim 2 will determine a) if chronic myocardial infarction/ischemia remodels the intrinsic cardiac nervous system such that this atrial arrhythmogenic neuronal substrate becomes enhanced and then to test the capacity of b) chronic SCS to modify synaptic interactions within the intrinsic cardiac nervous system in the suppression of atrial arrhythmias. Specific Aim 3 will determine if chronic myocardial infarction/ischemia adversely remodels intrinsic cardiac and extra cardiac intrathoracic autonomic neural function, thereby contributing to deterioration of cardiac mechanical function and, if so, whether chronic SCS mitigates such changes.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Interactions between central and peripheral aspects of the cardiac nervous system play a major role in control of the normal and stressed heart. Imbalances within this system are associated with deleterious effects including abnormal heart beats, sudden cardiac death and heart failure. The fundamental concept underpinning this proposal is to: 1) understand the interdependent interactions occurring within and between central and peripheral components of the cardiac neuronal hierarchy; 2) to determine how such linkages remodel in response to chronic cardiac stress (e.g. myocardial ischemia/infarction); and 3) to determine what are the optimum therapeutic strategies to target select elements of the cardiac nervous system to mitigate the progression of congestive heart failure and the potential for sudden cardiac death.\n",

      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      This is a competing renewal of a training program designed to prepare highly qualified individuals with prior training in developmental medicine for an investigative career by providing them the necessary skills to conduct collaborative research related to the Development of Cardiovascular and Pulmonary Function. Since its inception 29 years ago, the program has provided an in-depth research experience intended to teach the fundamentals of scientific investigation by the direct association of trainees with established investigators in a number of areas of biomedical science. Trainees spend 2-3 years participating in all activities of a research experience, and under the direct supervision of a training faculty member, take primary responsibility for a project. Training faculty are members of many clinical and basic science departments in the Yale School of Medicine, including Pediatrics, Pathology, Genetics, Cellular and Molecular Physiology, Internal Medicine and Immunobiology. In addition to a focused and intense research experience, the program has a core curriculum designed to provide basic skills in experimental design/analysis (for both basic and clinical research), data presentation, biostatistics, grant preparation and ethical scientific conduct. Most trainees are selected from a large, highly competitive pool of physicians from Yale and other institutions who are trained in pediatrics and desire a strong foundation in biomedical research in order to become independent investigators. While the program has emphasized research training for exemplary physicians, Ph.Ds seeking postdoctoral training in cardiopulmonary research are strongly encouraged to apply and have been supported in recent funding periods. Because most of the physician trainees need clinical as well as research training, the three clinical sections that primarily support this training grant have secured separate (non-NIH) funding to support the necessary advanced clinical training. Thus, the effort supported by this training grant is devoted to the acquisition of research skills. Additionally, the program director and training faculty view this grant as a vehicle to initiate career development in collaborative biomedical investigation and not as a mechanism to fully complete an trainee's research training. Thus trainees are encouraged to apply for extramural support to extend their research training, and they have been quite successful in obtaining such support.\n",

      "Description (provided by applicant): The overall objective of the Animal Core is to provide centerinvestigators with the ability to utilize animal models in the execution of their proposed researchprojects, as well as, establish new animal models for the investigation of the mechanisms involved in the regulation of reproduction. The Center for Reproductive Research will utilize two animal models, mice and rats, in the execution of the research projects. Although the use of animal models provides an invaluable source of reagents for investigating regulatory mechanisms in vivo, in a physiologically regulated system, the use of animals in biomedical research is costly with respect to equipment, animal resources and technical expertise. The Animal Core will serve as a resource for the execution and training in the use of all animal manipulations needed in the Center. The Animal Core will minimize the cost of utilizing animal models in the Center Research Program by consolidating the equipment, expertise and animal resources. This will ensure an efficient use of animal research at minimal cost.\n",

      "wound healing tissue wounds repair corneal matrix diabetic ecm mechanical\n",
      "--------------------\n",
      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Wound-healing complications are an important health concern that can be associated with diabetes, bed sores, and infection. The inability to form a stable provisional matrix over the wound site is a common hallmark of poor wound healing. Without a stable matrix, the migration of inflammation responsive cells such as endothelial cells, neutrophils and macrophages, needed to produce new blood vessels1 and fight infections is not possible. The goal of this project is to develop an imaging method to quantify the stability of theprovisional matrix during early-stage wound healing. This biological process has been largely invisible and the proposed work is expected to provide significant insight into molecular events that delay wound healing. Wound healing involves an intricate set of precisely timed processes that begin with the formation of a fibrin clot, followed by an inflammatory response, and eventually ending with extensive tissue remodeling and wound closure. During the inflammatory response, the provisional matrix is produced in part through the action of transglutaminase (TG) enzymes cross-linking plasma proteins such as fibrinogen and vitronectin. Recent work in our laboratory has shown that administration of infrared fluorescent-labeled substrates for the TGs, including both proteins and peptides, produces strong contrast for in vivo imaging.2 In this R21 project we will test whether our method can identify problems associated with unstable matrix formation in animal models by executing the following Specific Aims: (1) develop imaging strategies to support multiple time-point imaging in the healing cascade; (2) evaluate the performance of the multiple time point optical imaging method in vivo in a mouse model; and (3) compare provisional matrix stability through imaging matrix formation in a delayed wound healing model of the diabetic mouse. Multiple time-point imaging can monitor problems with both matrix formation and degradation processes. Slow matrix formation will be associated with poor incorporation of labeled substrate into the wound compared with controls. Excessive matrix degradation will be associated with rapid loss of labeled substrates in the wounds compared with controls. A successful project will lead to a new imaging method for studying wound healing and evaluating wound- healing response. In the near term, this method would be used in animal model studies to evaluate the wound- healing process and support the development of new approaches to promote wound healing. In the longer term, this method would be extended to clinical studies to identify the mechanisms of compromised healing and help in wound management. Furthermore, because similar cross-linking processes are involved in atherosclerosis3 and cancer,4 this imaging method will also find broader applications beyond wound healing.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Wound healing is a tremendously important process in human health, with a wide range of implications in diseases such as diabetic ulcers, bed sores, infection, and cancer. This proposal describes a method for optically monitoring the progress of the wound-healing process by probing the formation of the provisional matrix that provides a scaffold for migration of immune and endothelial cells. The proposed method should prove invaluable for research on wound healing in animal models and evaluation of new drugs, and will provide vital information for diagnosing and treating conditions involving abnormal or compromised wound healing.\n",

      "Few injuries are as physically and psychologically devastating as suffering a spinal cord injury (SCI).  Each year, over ten thousand North Americans suffer such an injury and are left permanently paralyzed, with limited to no movement of their arms and/or legs and a myriad of other health impairments such as bowel and bladder incontinence.  Unfortunately, there are no treatments available that unequivocally reverse this paralysis and improve neurologic recovery.  Much research has been done to develop novel therapies for SCI in the laboratory.  While these are promising, it will still be many years before the completion of clinical trials that test their effectiveness in human SCI.  This is little comfort to those who are injured today, particularly in combat situations where advanced and sophisticated neuro-restorative therapies may simply not be deliverable.  There is therefore an urgent need for treatments that can be more rapidly translated into the clinical setting to improve neurologic recovery in individuals who have suffered an acute spinal cord injury.Our research proposal aims to inform current treatment guidelines around the blood pressure management of acute SCI.  Blood pressure management in acute SCI is important because after traumatic injury the spinal cord's blood supply is reduced below critical levels, making the cord vulnerable to further irreversible ischemic injury.  Physicians attempt to improve the blood supply by increasing systemic blood pressure for the first week post-injury.  Current practice guidelines recommend using intravenous fluids and vasopressors to maintain the mean arterial pressure (MAP) at 85-90 mm Hg for 5-7 days post-injury in all acute SCI patients.  These guidelines, however, are not based on strong clinical evidence from high-quality clinical trials.  By promoting a  one-size-fits-all  approach, such hemodynamic guidelines ignore the possibility that the spinal cord and its blood flow respond differently depending upon whether the cord remains compressed or has been surgically decompressed after a period of prolonged compression lasting hours to days.The ultimate goal of our research is to inform clinical guidelines around the hemodynamic management of acute SCI patients by determining how alterations in systemic blood pressure influence the injured spinal cord before and after surgical decompression.  Our overall objective is to determine how hemodynamic support of systemic blood pressure in the presence or absence of spinal cord compression affects the vascular, metabolic, biochemical, and behavioral outcomes of traumatic SCI.  It is our hypothesis that increasing the blood pressure to improve blood supply to the injured spinal cord is helpful when the cord remains compressed, but, paradoxically, has deleterious effects when the cord is surgically decompressed.  Our pilot data using a large animal model of SCI have suggested that increasing the blood pressure after decompression leads to dramatically increased swelling of the spinal cord and an exaggerated metabolic response.  Such deleterious effects were hinted at many years ago, but these warnings have to some extent been overlooked in our current enthusiasm for driving up the blood pressure.To shed further light on the downstream effects of hemodynamic support, we will use a novel pig model of SCI that shares many anatomic and physiologic similarities with human SCI.  The pig spinal cord is much more similar in size to the human cord than the rat or mouse spinal cord.  Similarities in the pig spinal cord blood supply with that of humans have made it a routinely used animal model for studies of ischemic spinal cord injury.  Using our large animal model of SCI, we hypothesize that well-intended increases in MAP will exacerbate a so-called  reperfusion injury  and ultimately have deleterious effects on regions of the spinal cord surrounding the injury site.  Our experiment will evaluate both short-term (24 hours post-injury) and long-term (12 weeks post-injury) outcomes of MAP support before and/or after spinal cord decompression has occurred.Ultimately, a better understanding of how the spinal cord adjacent to the injury site responds to alterations in systemic blood pressure in the presence or absence of residual mechanical compression will help clinicians provide optimal hemodynamic management for patients with acute SCI and improve their chances of neurologic recovery.  This research has potential application to all patients with acute SCI, and importantly is relevant to front-line clinicians who are charged with managing these individuals and doing whatever possible to maximize their chances of neurologic recovery.  Blood pressure management is one of the few aspects of clinical care in acute SCI that physicians currently have some control over, and so it is highly relevant to seek ways of optimizing this management.  We do not discount the importance of novel and cutting-edge neuro-regenerative therapies -- clearly, these will be needed to advance the field of SCI research in the future.  However, we contend that work such as that which we propose is important to understand how we could potentially improve the delivery of care today.\n",

      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Stroke is the leading cause of disability in the United States. It is estimated that 700,000 people in the United States will experience a stroke each year and that there are over 5 million Americans living with a stroke. Regaining the ability to walk is an important goal for individuals who have experienced a stroke and it is often a primary focus of the rehabilitation of these individuals. Current research suggests that rehabilitation strategies that are based on task oriented, intensive training are necessary to induce use dependent neurologic reorganization in order to enhance motor and functional recovery after stroke. Constraint induced movement therapy (CIMT) has been shown to be effective in improving upper extremity motor control and functional use of the affected limb in real world situations in people with stroke. Our long-term goal is development and testing of a comprehensive, CIMT based intervention protocol to improve walking ability and lower extremity motor function in people with stroke. The purpose of this research project to take the first step toward this intervention protocol by developing and testing a novel shoe based sensor that can objectively and accurately monitor real world functional use of the affected lower extremity in people with stroke. This data can then be used to provide behavioral enhancing feedback to patients with stroke regarding the amount of walking they perform and the use of their affected lower extremity throughout the day in their home and community. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Stroke is the leading cause of disability in the United States (Gresham G, 1995). It is estimated that 700,000 people in the United States will experience a stroke each year and that there are over 5 million Americans living with a stroke. Regaining the ability to walk is an important goal for individuals who have experienced a stroke and it is often a primary focus of the rehabilitation of these individuals. In this project we propose to validate a novel shoe-based device that can provide behavioral enhancing feedback to stroke patients in rehabilitation therapy and potentially enhance rehabilitation outcomes.\n",

      "Hepatitis C virus is both difficult to treat and a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. It is not understood how hepatitis C establishes infection nor how some patients clear infection. To this end 83 humans exposed to hepatitis C were studied in protocol 00-DK-0221. The immune response (both antibody and T cell) was closely followed and is being characterized. The study is in collaboration with Dr. Rehermann. As an extension of this 28 patients with acute hepatitis C have been followed and treated as indicated. Twenty-five patients (16 women; mean age 43 years) had adequate follow up to be included in an analysis.  Symptoms in the acute phase were reported by 80% and jaundice by 40%. Two patients (8%) developed ascites and acute liver failure but both survived.  Genotype 1 was most frequent (72%) but many patients (20%) could not be genotyped.   Serum aminotransferase levels and HCV RNA levels fluctuated greatly; 18% of patients were intermittently negative for HCV RNA.   In follow up, 5 patients recovered spontaneously whereas 20 developed chronic hepatitis C or received interferon-based therapy during the acute phase.  Among 15 patients treated during the acute phase with peginterferon with or without ribavirin for 24 weeks, all became HCV RNA negative within 4 to 8 weeks, and all except two achieved a sustained virological response with the exceptions being HIV-positive.  Side effects (particularly psychiatric) were common and limited the duration of therapy in 30% of patients.  To further understand the virological determinants of infection and the development of chronicity, the hepatitis C virus sequence in the early stages of infection has been determined from the same patients. In particular the sequencing effort is focused on the viral sequence before and after treatment, in the two patients who were HIV positive and relapsed. The complete sequence has been determined and is now being analyzed. A second laboraratory project has been to study the nature of late relapse after treatment for hepatitis C. The first 103 patients who achieved a sustained virologic response at the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center were reviewed. Three patients had a late relapse. The viral sequence from these patients was studied from before treatment, from the liver at the time of sustained virologic response, and from the serum at the time of documented relapse. The viral sequences obtained from before treatment, the liver at the time of sustained virologic response, and from the serum at the time of relapse were all virtually identical proving relapse and not reinfection. A third laboratory project currently underway is to use viral sequencing to understand discrepancies in commercial genotyping assays.A collaborative project with Drs. Natanya Sandler and Danny Doueck was to determine the relationship between markers of microbial translocation and chronic liver disease. We investigated whether the extent and progression of liver disease in patients with chronic HBV or HCV infection are associated with microbial translocation and subsequent activation of monocytes. In a retrospective study, we analyzed data from 16 patients with minimal fibrosis, 68 with cirrhosis, and 67 uninfected volunteers. We analyzed plasma levels of soluble CD14 (sCD14), intestinal fatty acid binding protein, and interleukin-6 by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) by the limulus amebocyte lysate assay, at presentation and after antiviral treatment. Compared with uninfected individuals, HCV- and HBV-infected individuals had higher plasma levels of LPS, intestinal fatty acid binding protein (indicating enterocyte death), sCD14 (produced upon LPS activation of monocytes), and interleukin-6. Portal hypertension, indicated by low platelet counts, was associated with enterocyte death (P = .045 at presentation, P < .0001 after therapy). Levels of sCD14 correlated with markers of hepatic inflammation (P = .02 for aspartate aminotransferase, P = .002 for ferritin) and fibrosis (P < .0001 for &#947;-glutamyl transpeptidase, P = .01 for alkaline phosphatase, P < .0001 for &#945;-fetoprotein). Compared to subjects with minimal fibrosis, subjects with severe fibrosis at presentation had higher plasma levels of sCD14 (P = .01) and more hepatic CD14(+) cells (P = .0002); each increased risk for disease progression (P = .0009 and P = .005, respectively). LPS-induced local and systemic inflammation is associated with cirrhosis and predicts progression to end-stage liver disease in patients with HBV or HCV infection.A second type of chronic hepatitis studied is hepatitis D. Hepatitis D is the most aggressive form of viral hepatitis as well as the most difficult to treat. Interferon therapy is the standard approach. Patients are typically treated for 6 months to a year. Relapse after cessation of therapy is the norm. In protocol 01-DK-0247 patients are treated with peginterferon for 5 years. The dose is titrated to maintain normal ALT and minimize side effects. Patients are evaluated before initiating therapy, and after 1, 3, and 5 years. Patients are excluded if they do not meet protocol-defined criteria for response at the 1 year evaluation. Enrollment was planned for 10 - 20 patients. Thirteen patients have been enrolled, and of the 12 who have had one-year evaluations 10 have met the protocol definition of response. Most of the patients were male (11) and tended to have advanced disease (median baseline Ishak fibrosis - 4). Patients were treated for a mean duration of 144 weeks (range 6 - 300) at an average weekly peginterferon dose of 184 &#956;g. At one year of treatment, inflammatory scores were significantly improved (10.6  2.7 vs. 7  1.9, p<0.01) and this improvement persisted in 4 of 5 patients who had a 3 year biopsy scored. There was no difference in the fibrosis score. ALT decreased significantly after one year (136  143 vs. 46  13, p<0.05) and persistant biochemical response on treatment was achieved by 3 patients (27%). 3/13 patients (27%) lost HBsAg after 24, 37 and 202 weeks of treatment and developed HBs antibodies. Treatment was stopped in these patients at least 24 weeks later; the serological response was durable and was associated with persistent improvement of ALT and platelet count during follow-up. Two patients (15%) died during therapy, one from hepatocellular carcinoma and the other from herpes colitis. Both deaths were not considered related to treatment. There were no other serious adverse events and treatment was well-tolerated overall. 3 patients required a dose reduction due to cytopenias. The primary end point of the study is the evaluation after three years although it is planned to treat patients for 5 years. Hepatitis D viral RNA and hepatitis B surface antigen levels have been measured, the final analysis is currently being completed.\n",

      "asthma airway allergic allergen th2 airways asthmatic inflammation ige respiratory\n",
      "--------------------\n",
      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Although most patients are believed to have mild-to-moderate asthma that responds to inhaled corticosteroids, there are subpopulations of asthma patients with severe disease whose symptoms and control are largely unresponsive to treatment including systemic corticosteroids. Severe asthma affects 10% of all asthmatic subjects, but these patients have greater morbidity and a disproportionate need for health care support. The mechanisms of severe asthma are not determined, but respiratory infections cause the majority of asthma exacerbations and have profound and potentially long-lasting, effects on asthma including its severity and response to treatment. In attempting to evaluate mechanisms of severe asthma, striking similarities exist between features of severe asthma and the response to respiratory infections in asthma, including intensity of airflow obstruction, neutrophilic inflammation, and a diminished response to corticosteroids. These parallel features suggest that mechanisms of severe asthma may be related, at least in part, to similar events associated with respiratory infections. Rhinovirus infections have begun to emerge as principal contributors to many phases of asthma including inception and exacerbations and possibly severe asthma. It is speculated that respiratory infection effects on asthma severity are complex, multicellular and, in part, the result of a dysregulated immune response that allows RV to persist as an airway infection. Thus, it is hypothesized that severe asthma is caused, in some patients, by an infection with strains of rhinovirus resulting in changes in the airway milieu to create a phenotype shift in macrophages towards an alternatively activated population with reduced anti-viral actions to further a persistent infection, inflammation and obstruction. To test this hypothesis, the Systemic Triamcinolone in Asthma Characterization study will be applied to subjects with severe asthma compared to well-controlled asthma, to determine whether the differences are related to underlying corticosteroid therapy. The contribution of airway and parenchymal abnormalities to airflow limitation will be determined along with anatomic (imaging) changes in the lung, to correlate these changes with rhinovirus infections and inflammation. RT-PCR Multicode technology will be used to detect rhinovirus in respiratory tract samples and evaluate the effects of an infection on characteristics of severe asthma including inflammation through virus generation of cytokines and chemokines. Finally, the phenotype (classically activated vs. alternatively activated) and function (inflammatory vs. repair) of airway macrophages in severe asthma will be determined and their contribution to severe asthma determined. These studies will provide new insights into the mechanisms of asthma, particularly severe disease, and possibilities of new approaches to treatment.\n",

      "host infection bacterial infections bacteria biofilm virulence pathogen pathogens tb\n",
      "--------------------\n",
      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application seeks to address the impact of bacterial colonization and persistence in chronic wounds. The formation of biofilms has clearly been linked to chronic and persistent bacterial infections. This considerably delays and complicates wound healing. Unlike acute bacterial infections, which are often cleared by the host, biofilm-related chronic infections are not easily resolved even with high dose antibiotics and intact immunity. The bacterial pathogens Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus, which are the focus of this application, cause an array of biofilm-related clinical diseases including persistent airway infections, burn wound infections, endocarditis, and surgical site infections. Unresolved infected wounds also contribute to nosocomial persistence and the spread of bacteria in health care settings. The abundance and persistence of chronic infections due to biofilm formation has led to the hypothesis that biofilms deploy directed mechanisms to subvert recognition, activation, and functions of the host immune system. This proposal will use state-of-the- art molecular and genomic approaches to better understand the impact of bacterial colonization in chronic wounds. Aim 1 will define mechanisms by which P. aeruginosa and S. aureus resist killing by host-derived antimicrobials and innate immune cells. Aim 2 will utilize a newly developed porcine full thickness burn chronic wound model and explanted human tissue from burn wound debridement to investigate biofilm persistent infections caused by P. aeruginosa and S. aureus. The development of a chronic infection model that can be sampled over time as well as access to materials derived from humans suffering burn-wound injury provides a relevant, unique, and novel approach for examining the effects of biofilm formation in the host. Conclusions made from in vitro data will be efficiently tested in the porcine model and human tissue for applicability in clinical infection. Ultimately information gathered will aid the treatment of an array of chronic infections including highly prevalent persistent wound infections.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus are versatile opportunistic pathogens that can cause devastating persistent wound infections. Within the wound, these organisms transform into a resistant community called a biofilm. Biofilm-related chronic infections are not easily resolved even with high dose antibiotics and intact immunity. This application will use molecular and genomic approaches to define how biofilm-growing bacteria resist antibiotics and host immune cells. This will allow us to better understand the impact of bacterial colonization in chronic wounds and aid future management and treatment of chronic infections that significantly impact human health.\n",

      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is now well recognized that solid tumor progression is accompanied by the induction and maintenance of tumor antigen-specific T-cell tolerance through mechanisms akin to those that regulate responses to self-antigens. Unfortunately, this emerging view of tumor immunity has also raised the bar for cancer immunotherapy, since the barrier imposed by immune tolerance must be broken in order for the immune system to recognize and eliminate solid tumors expressing mainly  self . Given these sobering implications, the study of immunological tolerance, its establishment and maintenance has remained the central focus of our laboratory for the past several years. The elucidation of the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in the decision leading to immune activation versus immune tolerance represents a critical step not only to better understand the immune system, but also to identify potential targets to overcome the remarkable barrier that immune tolerance has imposed to cancer immunotherapy. The tools and experimental models developed in the last several years will be used to systematically pursue the overall goal of this project, which is to understand the mechanisms by which Stat3 signaling in bone marrow derived APCs influence the functional outcome of antigen-specific CD4 (Specific Aim 1) and CD8 T-cells (Specific Aim 2). Furthermore, in experimental models with model tumor antigens as well as true self/tumor antigens we will evaluate whether novel strategies targeting Stat3 signaling in APCs might overcome immune tolerance and enhance the efficacy of cancer vaccines (Specific Aim 3). The knowledge to be gained in this endeavor will provide the appropriate platform for future integration of novel therapeutic approaches targeting tolerogenic mechanisms in humans with already existing active immunotherapy strategies against solid tumors.\n",

      "--------------------\n",
      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal will study a recently recognized form of hearing disorder called auditory neuropathy (AN) that is due to a disorder of auditory nerve functions in the presence of normal cochlear receptor activities. AN subjects have normal measures of cochlear outer hair cell activities but abnormal measures of the central auditory pathway functions beginning with auditory nerve. The hearing disorder typically affects speech comprehension out-of-proportion to the pure tone loss, particularly speech recognition in noise. AN is not rare and accounts for 10 percent of newborns identified as having hearing loss and also develops in childhood and in adults. In adults the disorder of auditory nerve is commonly associated with a peripheral neuropathy. In addition, AN and sensory hearing loss occur together. Loss of neural synchrony and decreased auditory nerve input are proposed as cardinal mechanisms underlying the hearing disorder. The sites of abnormality along auditory nerve have recently been identified at auditory ganglion cells and their axons (Type I AN) or distally in the auditory periphery where auditory nerve terminals, inner hair cells, and the synapses between inner hair cells with nerve terminals are in close approximation (Type II AN). Our long-term goals are to understand the underlying mechanisms of AN and the accompanying hearing impairments to provide a scientific basis for alleviating the hearing deficit in AN subjects. We propose four experiments using both psychophysical and electrophysiological techniques that will help us achieve these goals. We will characterize (1) the reorganization of central auditory pathway occurring in response to altered auditory nerve input; (2) the contributions of dysynchronization and decreased auditory input as pathophysiological mechanisms underlying AN; (3) the objective physiological and psychophysical measures of improved auditory temporal processes in cochlear implanted AN subjects, and (4) the improvement of speech recognition using new auditory processing techniques. The results of our studies could have major impact on the diagnosis, classification, understanding, and treatment of auditory neuropathy.\n",

      "Understanding the structural and functional relationships and interactions between past and present climate, the geomorphic setting, natural disturbance regimes, and the anthropogenic history for impacting grassland, shrubland and desert ecosystems is necessary to determine ecosystem stability , resilience, or change in response to future climate changes.  To sustain or restore both ecosystem function and ecosystem services we need to better understand the interactions between the mix of human and natural disturbances, the critical thresholds associated with each, and how they will be affected by climate change.    A major complication of this goal is the increasing presence of invasive species and our limited understanding of what controls community stability.  Effective restoration following disturbance also requires better understanding of why the observed changes have occurred, particularly where climate change has had, and will have, a major influence.  Climates have changed constantly over the last two million years.  Considerable biotic change has resulted from the north-south and elevational migrations of plant species that has occurred throughout the region in response to past climate change during both the Pleistocene and the Holocene.  Climate changes have also been linked to geomorphic driven abiotic changes.  Plant species have responded independently to these past changes in climate and geomorphology, resulting in periodic reshuffling of community composition, particularly when the biotic or abiotic changes result in thresholds being crossed.  Long-term changes in natural disturbance patterns, in geomorphic processes and in vegetation dynamics, will continue into the future as a result of changes in local envronmental conditions resulting from climate change and anthropogenetically driven global change.  These changes will increasingly alter the environmental and biotic interactions with unknown affects on the structural and functional relationships of ecosystems, and their ability to provide ecosystem services. Objective(s): Acquire an improved understanding of climate and climate variability as drivers of past and present grassland, shrubland, and desert flora and faunal compositions, distributions, and ecosystem processes to assist in devising meaningful management scenarios for responding to potential future climatic changes Approach:  1.Continue to develop an understanding of how Great Basin upland and riparian plant communities have  responded to past climate changes; to provide better understanding of how vegetation may respond to the interactions of disturbance from future climate changes and land use activities, of critical thresholds that may be involved, and of their ability to maintain ecosystem services.  2.Continue landscape scale studies of changes in pinyon-juniper woodlands over the last 150 years to better understand how those woodland changes are anomalous when compared to the previous three to four centuries.  Identify existing and potential future thresholds in the landscapes, and how they will determine future conditions.   With the majority of these ongoing changes occurring over the next 50 years, the expected result will be an increase in the size and intensity of wildfires, and the loss of ecosystem services.  Research will continue on identifying the landscape locations, the extent and any thresholds associated with these changes, including the risk of conversion to dominance by invasive grasses and forbs.  3Continue identification of the past and possible future geomorphic changes associated with climate change that strongly influence plant community distribution, and responses to disturbance along riparian corridors provided by the Ecosystem Management Project for Restoring and Maintaining Great Basin Riparian Ecosystems with emphasis on identification of critical thresholds.4.Continue the development of methods for maintaining and restoring riparian communities and their ecosystem services based on information on how they are affected by climate change provided by the ongoing Ecosystem Management Project for Restoring and Maintaining Great Basin Riparian Ecosystems.  5.Identify the influences of climate, fire, and succession on landscape dynamics of western National Parks and how they will be altered by climate change.6.Identify how climate change will affect the distribution and abundance of vegetation on the southern Colorado Plateau and Great Basin. 7.Continue research on current plant-climate relationships in the western US, and on how climate change will affect those relationships and the landscape distribution of key ecosystems. 8.Identify and assess the impacts of climate change on forest and rangeland resources of the US.9.Update long-term investigations regarding the interactions of climate variability, climate change and the expansion of invasive species, its effects on sagebrush and salt-desert grass-shrubland composition and stability, its effects on wildlife habitat, and its effects on livestock forage availability.10.Explore the role of climate variation as a driver of historic fire regimes at local to sub-continental scales, and use to anticipate how they may be influenced or altered by climate change.11.Identify and evaluate grassland ecosystem health indicators that can be incorporated into models of ecological succession, with particular reference to identifying thresholds to natural stresses and human-induced disturbances and their modification by climate change.\n",

      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):        Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), a highly prevalent, chronic psychiatric disorder, often co-occurs with other psychiatric disorders, is associated with occupational and social dysfunction, and can lead to chronic disability. PTSD is also a risk factor for a number of health-related concerns including chronic pain and cardiovascular disease and is associated with significant economic burden. Veterans are at increased risk for PTSD with prevalence rates up to 3 times those who are non-Veterans. Existing PTSD treatments have been found to be less effective for Veterans with PTSD, in fact, combat-related trauma has been associated with the lowest treatment effect sizes in studies of PTSD treatments. Veterans with PTSD often experience difficulty engaging in traditional CBT exposure based approaches, which can trigger the uncomfortable emotional arousal they want to avoid. Further, the repeated nature of trauma exposure resulting from multiple and longer deployments, mental health stigma within military culture, and administration time, resources, and costs for mass populations such as the military, all contribute to decreased implementation and possibly efficacy of existing PTSD treatments. Therefore, novel and adjunctive interventions for the treatment of PTSD are sorely needed for Veterans with PTSD.  The aim of the proposed research is to examine the potential of exercise as an adjunctive intervention for PTSD in Veterans. There is a growing body of literature that supports the efficacy of exercise interventions in treating clinically diagnosed populations with various psychiatric disorders, and increasing physical activity has the potential to be cost-effective, flexible, and accessible. Veterans may find engaging in exercise as a more acceptable, less stigmatizing approach to managing PTSD symptoms. We propose to conduct a small, randomized clinical trial with 50 Veterans in treatment for PTSD randomized to receive either an adjunctive aerobic exercise (AE) intervention or a contact control health education comparison (HEC) intervention. The pilot RCT will allow us to 1) determine the feasibility of recruitment and randomization, 2) determine the acceptability of the AE and HEC conditions, and 3) to provide preliminary evidence of the effects of AE. This project will thus lay the groundwork for a subsequent randomized controlled trial with adequate statistical power to test the efficacy of AE in reducing PTSD symptoms, decreasing anxiety and depressive symptoms, and increasing quality of life and cardiorespiratory fitness in Veterans with PTSD.  The longer term significance of this project lies in the potential for adapting the AE intervention for use inVA hospitals nationwide. The larger aim of this program of research is to disseminate an effective, aerobic exercise intervention that can be readily integrated into PTSD treatment programs across treatment settings within Veterans Administration (VA) hospitals. Future dissemination of this approach could result in high public health significance in decreasing the overall severity of PTSD symptomatology in Veterans, thereby reducing PTSD-related morbidity.\n",

      "--------------------\n",
      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Vision is one of the enduring puzzles of modern cognitive science and elucidating the mechanisms of visual object perception presents a particular challenge. Nothing in the reflected light that arrives at the retina contains direct information about the location, shape, size, or number of objects in view. Understanding how the brain processes visual stimuli to derive this information would be a major advance in visual science. Because birds are active and mobile, avian visual systems must resolve the same problems that have driven theoretical advances in human and machine vision research. Examining these issues in such small, non-mammalian systems adds substantially to the development of a unified general theory of vision. Using our well-developed psychophysical techniques based on discrimination learning, we propose to evaluate this problem by examining in how starlings and pigeons process visual stimuli in controlled analytical contexts. This will bethe first parallel comparison of visual processing in two avian species. The overall objective of this application is to investigate and compare how these species solve central problems of visual cognition and object perception as related to the processing of illumination and shading, edge processing and figural grouping, and the recognition and classification of behavior and action. Our specific aims include: 1) equating our procedures for the comparative examination of visual processing in these species; 2) examining the processing of surface shading and its contributions to object and depth perception; 3) examining edge and figural grouping processes in shape perception; and 4) examining the mechanisms of visually-mediated action and movement recognition. The current project is a part of our long-term objective to understand the proximate psychological, computational and neural mechanisms by which different pattern recognition systems perceive, recognize, categorize, integrate, understand, and respond to complex visual information. The unique combination of visual power, small size, and different neural organization exemplified by birds offers a special scientific opportunity for better understanding this extremely important sensory modality and how it functions and is implemented across different classes of animals. This comparison will address whether there are only a few biologically plausible mechanisms for rapid visual processing of objects or whether there are multiple routes to functional vision in highly mobile organisms. Because there is strong evolutionary pressure for highly efficient and rapid computation of visual information placed on the small, highly visual brain of birds, our results will contribute directly to the pracical development of treatments, corrective solutions or prostheses for humans with a variety of visual disorders and to the design of visual sensors for self-guided bio-mimetic robotic devices.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Visual perception is critical to virtually every aspect of human behavior. Using new modifications to a behavioral approach that has consistently yielded important information about vision and its mechanisms, the primary goal of our proposed research is the comparative analysis of visual perception of objects and movement in two bird species. We expect that our results will constitute a significant advance in our understanding of visual object perception and contribute to treatments or corrective solutions for humans suffering from a wide variety of visual disorders or deficits.\n",

      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): With an estimated annual incidence of 300,000-350,000 and accounting for 50% of all cardiovascular deaths in the US, sudden cardiac death (SCD) is a condition with significant implications for public health. Despite ongoing treatment advances in resuscitation science, survival among out-of-hospital cardiac arrest victims is <10%, making SCD prediction and prevention essential. While SCD risk is strongly associated with increasing age, manifestation in middle age (35-59 yr; approx. 30% of all SCD) is the most significant contributor to societal burden. However, published studies of SCD have focused almost exclusively on older patients (Ã¯Â¿Â½60 yr), partly explained by insufficient numbers of middle-aged SCD cases among existing cardiovascular cohort studies. We have recently reported evidence for a distinctive profile of SCD in middle age compared to older age, indicating the significance of identifying middle age-specific SCD mechanisms. Middle aged SCD patients were more likely to present without prior warning, with obesity and non-white race playing a more important role. The overall hypothesis of this proposal is that a detailed and focused examination of novel factors associated with SCD in middle age will enhance the understanding of mechanisms and contribute to improved SCD risk prediction and prevention. Our specific aims are 1) To identify features of malignant coronary events that provoke lethal arrhythmias in middle age 2) To identify novel obesity-related risk factors contributing to SCD risk; and 3) To identify patient subgroups at highest risk of SCD in middle age.  Over twelve years ago, we initiated the Oregon Sudden Unexpected Death Study (Oregon SUDS) to identify novel risk predictors for SCD. This large study among one million residents of the Portland, Oregon metro area continues to accrue a significant number of SCD cases and controls. The critical need to identify risk predictors for SCD in middle age currently represents the largest knowledge gap in SCD. The established Oregon SUDS provides a unique discovery population with sufficient numbers of subjects, coupled with the opportunity to leverage existing detailed clinical and biomarker information. There is a high likelihood of identifying clinically and mechanistically relevant predictors of SCD risk that will enhance prediction and prevention of SCD.\n",

      "Part 1.The optical network of the future will have orders of magnitude increase in data rates, due at least partially to the increase in big-data transactions. These create the need for fast scheduling of network resources and agile network adaptation to most efficiently move the data across the network.  This project proposes to investigate a cognitive network management and control system, which 'senses' current network conditions and uses this information to satisfy overall performance goals. This project will be the first comprehensive research on cognitive optical network management and control. The goal is for agile automated adaptation to replace current slow, manually-driven management and control practices. The fruits of this research will have implications for next generation wireless networks and power grid systems and for fast detection of extreme events that can significantly disrupt networks. Part 2.Current optical networks are operated with predominantly static connections, with lightpaths changed quasi-statically and often remaining unchanged for months. Present methods of setting up a wavelength path result in slow changes to the network (~20 min setup times), as each of the network elements along the path is gradually tuned to avoid instabilities and transient impairments arising from rapidly introducing another optical channel into the network. Large flow and other traffic dynamics will require bandwidth adaptations of the order of ~100mS-1S.  In today's optical networks, the link quality of all adjacent wavelengths is monitored as the lightpath is turned on in several steps. The number of network parameters and their short coherence time in dynamic future networks render acquiring the complete state information of the network impractical. The idea of this project is to sense and control a small subset of the parameters with the 'largest' information content and use their relationship to tune the network. Cognitive techniques that need to be incorporated in such a strategy include sampling of network and link parameters, applying data analytics to learn behavior and cognitive techniques to operate networks, and inferring network state and optimizing performance without placing an undue network control and management communications burden on the network. This research will consider both dynamic per-session scheduling, rerouting/load-balancing and topology reconfiguration to optimize network performance.\n",

      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  In the first two funding cycles of this grant, we have characterized the molecular structure and function of Cutaneous Lymphocyte Antigen or CLA. We have also made the surprising observation that in humans, the vast majority (>90 percent) of CLA+ skin homing T cells are not in peripheral blood, but rather are in skin at any given time. These cells appear to enter skin directly from blood, through constitutively expressed E selectin, chemokine ligands, and LFA-1 on dermal microvasculature. These observations suggest that memory responses in skin to antigens originally encountered through skin may not require acute extravasation of circulating memory T cells. To more fully define the immunophysiology of these phenomena, we have used murine models of cutaneous infection with vaccinia virus to track a T cell mediated, antigen-specific immune response from draining lymph node and subsequently to both skin as well as other peripheral tissues and secondary lymphoid tissues. These observations provided us with a model of how cutaneous immunization leads to both a robust skin homing response via imprinting of effector memory T cells in draining lymph node, as well as a vigorous systemic response, by migration of subset of central memory T cells throughout the body. In the next five years, we propose to further dissect antigen specific T cell trafficking after cutaneous infection as means to better understand the biology of skin homing T cell trafficking and recirculation through skin. Using gene deficient mice, we will explore the role of the skin homing molecules that discovered were important in the last grant cycle, including PSGL-1, CD43, and FucTVII. We will use parabiotic mouse models to test hypotheses about the trafficking of T cells from skin to LN, blood, and ultimately back to skin. Finally, we will use these models to discover mechanisms and the kinetics of T cell migration through skin. Taken together, these studies will allow us to test clinically important hypotheses about the biology of skin homing T cells. Understanding the biology of these cells is central to modifying their function in the course of treating human diseases. Moreover, because many vaccines are delivered through skin, understanding how such cutaneous responses lead to systemic immunity will help us improve the quality and impact of modern vaccine therapy. PROJECT NARRATIVE: A better understanding of how skin homing T cells are generated after skin immunization, and how memory T cells enter and exit skin, is critical for developing better treatments for skin diseases. It is also critical for development and optimization of vaccines, the majority of which are given via skin immunization. Knowledge generated from this grant application over the next five years will have a significant impact on both areas.\n",

      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Numerous neurological diseases are characterized by a sex difference. The neuropathology often includes infiltration of immune cells, with this immune infiltration potentially contributing to disease pathogenesis. Since it is known that sex differences exist in the immune system, this confounds investigations into sex differences in the CNS. Thus, we will use bone marrow chimeras to investigate sex differences in the CNS. By varying sex chromosomes or sex hormones in hosts reconstituted with a common immune system, one can ascertain the role of sex chromosomes and sex hormones on the brain response to injury. We will use one of the most inflammatory of all CNS disease models, the multiple sclerosis model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), to show applicability of this approach to a variety of neurological diseases. We will employ mice which differ in the complement of sex chromosomes (XX vs. XY), while having the same gonadal type, to determine the effect of sex chromosomes in the absence of confounding effects of exposure to different types of sex hormones. Specifically, in aim #1 we will determine whether the greater severity of EAE in XX, as compared to XY-, mice is due to sex chromosome effects in the CNS. In aim #2, we will determine if the sex chromosome effect in the CNS during EAE is due to the dose of X or Y genes. Finally in aim #3, we will use mice which differ in gonadal type, female vs. male, while having the same sex chromosome complement (XX vs. XX Sry) to determine whether the greater severity of EAE in female, as compared to male, mice is due to sex hormone effects in the CNS.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This is an exploratory (R21) grant to determine the effect of sex chromosomes and sex hormones on the central nervous system's response to an immune attack using the multiple sclerosis model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. This proposal will establish a model system to determine the effect of sex chromosomes and sex hormones on a variety of neurological diseases characterized by a sex difference.\n",

      "Social animals possess sophisticated cognitive abilities for assessing, evaluating, and responding to a wide range of social cues. These social abilities allow individuals to display flexible behavior based on their social status and interactions, which is known as social competence. Despite the detailed understanding of importance of social competence little is known about the mechanisms, neural and molecular, that regulate this ability. Knowledge of how responses are regulated will provide essential understanding of social response, both typical and atypical, and allow ultimately for predictions about specific responses by individuals.  The research uses an interesting model system to address these questions the African cichlid fish, Astatotilapia burtoni. These fish are highly social and display extraordinary cognitive abilities, and can even use known relationships to deduce unknown ones to infer the social rank of other individuals transitively. This research will provide opportunities to train undergraduate and graduate students in neuroscience and prepare them for careers in science and outreach to the general public.The specific goal of this research is cichlid fish to identify the neural circuitry, molecular signaling, and regulatory mechanisms involved in social competence.  The proposal hypothesizes that dopamine acting through the D2 receptor mediates the neural social network potentiating social competence. Dopamine plays a particularly important role in encoding the rewarding properties of social stimuli and is known to modulate motivated, goal-directed behavior. The researchers integrate behavioral, neuroanatomical, pharmacological and genomic approaches to discover (1) how animals behave in response to subtle social information; (2) how social information rewires neural circuits on a short time scale; (3) how manipulation of the dopaminergic pathway governs behavioral flexibility; and (4) how social information and the dopaminergic system interact to affect genome activity. The results thus far suggest that not only do individuals respond to a social stimulus differently depending on the social context, but that the behavioral effects of manipulating the dopaminergic reward system also differ across contexts. Given that the neural networks governing social behavior are remarkably conserved across all vertebrates, the results of the planned research will have far-reaching implications for how the brains of social animals, including humans, perceive and respond to their social environment.\n",

      "Ã¯Â»Â¿   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Exercise participation is an important determinant of cognitive health, particularly in aging. In fact, sedentary behavior has been singled out as the greatest modifiable risk factor causing cognitive decline and Alzheimer's Disease in the US, and ranks third worldwide. Despite the importance of physical activity and exercise, the exercise parameters that provide optimal cognitive health are not well defined, particularly with respect tothe frequency and duration of exercise needed. Our data and others suggest that the exercise conditions that activate the underlying neurobiological mechanisms that enhance cognitive function can be flexible, and allow for intermittent and spaced exercise bouts. We propose the novel hypothesis that exercise establishes a type of  molecular memory  for the exercise stimulus, which regulates the frequency and duration of subsequent intermittent exercise that is needed to maintain cognitive benefits. The molecular memory remains during a defined temporal window, such that subsequent exercise (even low-level exercise normally sub-threshold to enhance long-term memory formation) can capitalize on the neurobiological events established by the initial experience of exercise, thus maintaining the benefits of exercise on cognitive function. We hypothesize that epigenetic mechanisms are fundamental for the molecular memory phenomenon, and serve to alter transcriptional processes through histone modifications to create stable changes in neuronal plasticity and giving rise to stable changes in behavior. Our goal in this proposal is to define the exercise parameters that establish a molecular memory, investigate the underlying mechanisms that enable exercise to more efficiently promote enhanced cognition, and explore if pharmaceutical manipulation can extend the molecular window established by exercise. Because benefits of exercise for improving cognition, particularly hippocampal function, rely in large part from induction of the key plasticiy molecule `brain-derived neurotrophic factor' (BDNF), we focus on BDNF induction and epigenetic modifications that control BDNF regulation. We propose three Aims. Aim 1 - Determine the effective exercise patterns and molecular memory temporal windows that result in long-term memory formation. Aim 2 - Determine the histone modification patterns resulting from exercise that establish a molecular memory for BDNF expression. Aim 3 - Determine if cognitive benefits of exercise can be prolonged by pharmacological manipulation of the epigenetic molecular memory established by exercise, using a novel selective histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) inhibitor. Overall, our research in this proposal will serve as a foundation for ultimately translating to humans the exercise parameters needed to maintain enhanced cognitive function.\n",

      "A complementarity system is a dynamical system defined by an ordinary differential equation (ODE) involving the solutions of a finite-dimensional complementarity problem parameterized by the state of the differential equation.  Complementarity systems constitute a new mathematical paradigm that finds a wide range of applications in nonsmooth mechanics, robotics, multi-body dynamics, switched circuit systems, economic and traffic systems, and even biological systems.  As such, the rigorous study of these systems is warranted.  Due to their intrinsically nonsmooth characteristics, such a study defies classical dynamical systems theory and requires novel mathematical analysis, computational and design tools.  This proposed project is devoted to the investigation of challenging issues in the analysis and control of complementarity systems.  We propose to apply state-of-art techniques from mathematical programming, convex analysis, systems theory, and control theory to tackle these problems.  On the analytical side, we will address several fundamental and critical issues of system behavior, e.g., existence and uniqueness of solutions and Zeno property, which are directly related to numerical computation and system analysis.  Moreover, we aim at studying controllability and observability and developing control algorithms that will be applied to robot motion planning, multi-body systems subject to unilateral constraints, and constrained dynamic optimization problems.Dynamical systems modeled by ODEs provide a powerful mathematical and computational framework for the study and understanding of a wide range of time-dependent physical phenomena that naturally occur in many engineering applications.  As the application areas expand, researchers and designers are encountering increasingly complex systems subject to various constraints, which arise as a result of the global behavior of the systems and the interactions between them and their complex environment and/or other systems at different levels.  A trivial example of such constraints is a falling object before and after hitting the ground.  At the instant where the object touches the ground, an impact occurs followed by a rebounce of the object that results in a change of direction of the object's motion.  This is a mode transition.  The proposed research aims at treating dynamical systems where mode transition is an unknown but important component of the overall system configuration.  If successful, the results of the research will let us gain a better understanding of many complex engineering systems with mode changes and will provide a solid foundation for the improved design of such systems that in turn will have a significant impact on many practical fields.  The proposed work will also contribute to the advancement of basic sciences and to the education and training of the human workforce.\n",

      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): More than 1 million women of childbearing age in the U.S. report disabilities or needing assistance with activities of daily living, primarily because of chronic physical impairments that cause mobility difficulties. Anecdotal reports suggest that growing numbers of women with physical disabilities are choosing to become pregnant and bear children. Nonetheless, little information is available about the prevalence of women in the U.S. with physical disabilities who become pregnant and about their obstetrical experiences. The overall goal of this mixed-methods study is to provide systematic albeit exploratory evidence about pregnancy and childbearing experiences among U.S. women with chronic physical disabilities, with three specific aims: 1. To analyze four data sources, each of which contains information on different sets of women - the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), the National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG), the National Spinal Cord Injury Database (NSCID), and the Sonya Slifka Longitudinal Multiple Sclerosis Study (Slifka) database - to explore pregnancy prevalence among women with chronic physical disabilities and to identify sociodemographic and physical functional characteristics associated with pregnancy; 2. To review medical records at an academic medical center with a high risk obstetrical program to describe the prenatal course, labor and delivery, and birth outcome experiences of women with physical disabilities and women's sociodemographic and physical functional characteristics; and 3. To explore themes related to women's perceptions of how disability affected the pregnancy experience, including patient factors (e.g., perceptions and expectations about becoming pregnant, disability identity, the delivery experience), patients' perceptions of clinician factors (e.g., perceived attitudes of clinicians during pregnancy, labor and delivery, and immediate postpartum period), and environmental factors (e.g., patients' perceptions of accessibility of services during pregnancy and the puerperium). This project would represent an initial effort to quantify the prevalence of pregnancy among U.S. women with physical disabilities. The results would provide entirely new information concerning an understudied population, which has great personal importance for a historically disadvantaged group of women who have frequently experienced disparities in health care. Although exploratory, this study will lay an essential foundation for future research about pregnancy among women with physical disabilities. It will identify questions that need to be addressed and provide information about the utility of different data sources for exploring issues relating to pregnancy among women with physical disabilities. Our qualitative findings will offer additional insight into difficulties and barriers women with disabilities face during their obstetrical care, as well as potential suggestions for addressing these problems.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: More than 1 million women of childbearing age in the U.S. report physical disabilities, primarily from chronic mobility impairments. Anecdotal reports suggest that growing numbers of women with physical disabilities are choosing to become pregnant and bear children, but little is known about their prevalence or their pregnancy and childbearing experiences. In addition to providing insight into their experiences by interviewing women, this project would involve an initial effort to quantify the national prevalence of pregnancy among U.S. women with physical disabilities, producing entirely new information concerning an understudied group of women who have frequently experienced disparities in health care.\n",

RNA assembly reactions and exchange among alternative RNA structures play key roles in transcription, translation, viral replication and RNA processing reactions. Quantitative analyses of specific RNA folding events in most RNA-mediated biological processes are complicated by the participation of many components in complex pathways. On the other hand, RNA enzymes report on assembly of functional RNA structures directly through their catalytic activity. Studies of RNA folding using RNA enzymes as model systems in vitro have produced a wealth of information regarding the kinetics and equilibria of individual steps of RNA- mediated reactions and the influence of small molecules, RNA binding proteins, and RNA transcription on RNA assembly pathways in simple test tube reactions. Our goal is to learn how the principles that have been elucidated through in vitro studies translate to the behavior of RNAs in the complex environment of a cell. The hairpin ribozyme is an especially valuable model for RNA structure-function studies in vivo because ribozyme variants have been designed so that intracellular cleavage activity monitors specific RNA conformational transitions along the reaction pathway. Specific goals are 1) to use inter-molecular ribozyme cleavage activity to probe the specificity, kinetics and equilibria of RNA complex formation in vivo, 2) use ribozyme variants with the potential to adopt defined nonfunctional secondary structures to distinguish rapid conformational exchange and delayed folding models of intracellular RNA assembly, 3) determine how post- translational RNA re-folding pathways differ from co-transcriptional folding and 4) characterize the kinetics and equilibria of small ligand-induced RNA conformational transitions in vivo. Mechanistic insights gleaned using this simple system to report on RNA structure and dynamics in specific biological contexts will help illuminate mechanisms of more complex RNA-mediated reactions and provide a rational framework for the development of RNA-based therapeutics.\n",

      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Development of allergic airway disease in mice depends on IL-4R1-mediated activation of Stat6 by IL-4 and IL- 13, with the latter cytokine being more important than the former during the effector phase of disease. We have evaluated the cell types through which IL-4 and IL-13 contribute to allergic airway disease and explored mechanisms responsible for the greater effects of IL-13. Results show that: 1) inhaled IL-4 and IL-13 can each independently induce airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) in mice through direct effects on airway smooth muscle cells; 2) AHR is induced independently of eosinophilia and goblet cell hyperplasia; 3) induction of AHR by IL-4 and IL-13 requires signaling through the type 2 IL-4R; 4) IL-4, but not IL-13, induces increased secretion of IFN-3 and IL-10, cytokines that can suppress allergic airway disease; 5) IL-4 signaling through the type 1 IL-4R suppresses the expression of some of the genes induced in the lungs by IL-13; and 6) IL-13 suppresses expression of miR-1, a microRNA expressed in muscle that suppresses translation of multiple genes that promote differentiation, proliferation and responsiveness. Concurrent studies by other investigators have shown that: 1) IL-13 can induce AHR through direct effects on pulmonary epithelium, but also induces AHR in mice whose pulmonary epithelium cannot directly respond to this cytokine; and 2) the type 2 IL-4R binds IL-13 differently and with greater affinity than it binds IL-4. Taken together, these observations suggest our 3 central hypotheses: 1) induction of AHR by IL-4 and IL-13 is completely accounted for by their effects on smooth muscle and airway epithelium; 2) IL-4/IL-13-induced changes in smooth muscle gene transcription and translation contribute to the effects of these cytokines on airway responsiveness and muscle remodeling and 3) the greater ability of inhaled IL-13 than IL-4 to increase AHR in mice results from IL-4 activation of the type 1 IL-4 receptor (IL-4R), with consequent production of IFN-3 and IL-10, rather than from differences in IL-4 vs. IL- 13 signaling through the type 2 IL-4R or IL-13R12. These hypotheses will be tested by 4 specific aims: 1. Determine whether IL-13 induction of AHR is prevented by deleting IL-4R1 from both smooth muscle and epithelial cells. 2. Compare development of chronic airway remodeling in mice that overexpress IL-4 or IL-13 in their lungs and selectively express IL-4R1 on smooth muscle or pulmonary epithelium. 3. Evaluate the effects of miR-1 downregulation on airway responsiveness and Identify genes that are up- or downregulated by IL-4 and IL-13 on airway smooth muscle cells. 4. Determine whether induction of IFN-3 and/or IL-10 by IL-4 contributes to the stronger induction of AHR by IL-13. Proposed experiments will use transgenic mice, recombinant cytokines, monoclonal antibodies, cell transfer systems, assays of in vivo cytokine production, flow cytometry and 3 different techniques for measuring airway responsiveness to test our hypothesis. Results should improve understanding of asthma pathogenesis, provide a model that can be used for in vivo tests of agents that may regulate smooth muscle-dependent AHR in human asthma and provide information that should guide the choice of IL-13 vs. IL-4R antagonists as potential asthma therapeutics.     PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Asthma, a chronic lung disease characterized by airway smooth muscle hyperplasia and hyperresponsiveness, affects more than 7% of Americans and has been increasing in incidence for the past 50 years. Two cytokines, IL-4 and IL-13, induce acute and chronic changes in pulmonary structure and function that contribute to airway hyperresponsiveness. However, mechanisms responsible for IL-4- and IL-13-induced changes in smooth muscle structure and function that contribute to airway hyperresponsiveness are poorly understood, as are mechanisms that account for differences in the effects of IL-4 vs. IL-13. Proposed studies with a mouse model in which airway hyperresponsiveness is induced solely by direct IL-4 and IL-13 effects on smooth muscle should help to elucidate these mechanisms and may reveal new approaches for asthma therapy.\n",

      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, inflammatory neurodegenerative disease that affects the central nervous system and may lead to severe disability within 10-15 years. MS is diagnosed by clinical symptoms and presence of inflammation detected by magnetic resonance imaging. Other diseases present with similar symptoms, so diagnosis of MS is challenging. The lack of clear and objective biomarkers for diagnosis, monitoring, or prediction of outcomes complicates MS detection and treatment of MS patients. We propose to use a novel assay developed in our laboratory for analysis of DNA methylation to identify MS-specific changes of DNA methylation in multiple genes within each specimen, and to create a composite biomarker combining genes with the most diverse patterns of methylation. The blood-brain barrier is disrupted in MS patients, genomic DNA from dead cells is released into the bloodstream, so the assay can be based on cell-free circulating DNA. Specific Aims of the project are: (1) to establish a composite biomarker for detection of patients with relapsing-remitting MS in remission based on DNA methylation profile of cell-free circulating plasma DNA; (2) to establish a composite biomarker for detection of patients with relapsing-remitting MS during exacerbations based on DNA methylation profile of cell-free circulating plasma DNA, and to compare it with the biomarker established in Aim 1; (3) to compare DNA methylation profiles of patients with relapsing- remitting MS and secondary-progressive MS and to determine biomarkers specific for progression. The assay allows simultaneous detection of methylation in 56 gene promoters using DNA from 0.15 ml of plasma. The assay successfully detected MS-specific changes in DNA from plasma of MS patients. Completion of this project will produce a novel set of objective observer-independent biomarkers based on a fast, simple, and inexpensive procedure, and utilizing a simple, safe, and minimally invasive specimen collection. There are no reports on MS-specific DNA methylation, so this project will be the first to address this deficiency. The utility of cell-free circulating DNA for testing in MS has never been reported, so this project will be the first to use this opportunity. Consequently, other components of this project are without precedent: a biomarker for different forms of RR-MS, a biomarker for prediction of an attack, and a biomarker for disease progression to SP-MS will be developed for the first time. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the central nervous system, which can lead to severe disability and death. Diagnosis of MS is difficult because initial stages of the disease do not have obvious symptoms or even any symptoms at all, and there are no objective markers specific for MS. In this project we will use a new technique developed in our laboratory to evaluate DNA modifications (methylation) in blood of MS patients with active MS (attack or exacerbation) and stable MS (remission). Completed project will provide the first objective biomarker based on MS-specific DNA methylation, which can be used for diagnosis of MS, for evaluation of treatments success, and for prediction of outcomes.\n",

      "nerve regeneration injury glaucoma peripheral optic axons axon axonal nerves\n",
      "--------------------\n",
      "Background:  Traumatic nerve injuries often require surgical repair with an autologous nerve graft, increasing peri-operative risks and adding morbidity at the harvesting site.  Furthermore, donor sites are often less accessible in war wounds and, even with autologous nerve grafts, functional recovery is often imperfect.  Multiple strategies are being developed as a replacement for the sural nerve grafts, but none of the currently FDA-approved products in the market is effective as a replacement for autologous sural nerve grafts.  Recently, we have demonstrated that biodegradable fibers, when placed longitudinally in nerve guides, improve peripheral nerve regeneration by providing contact guidance to regenerating axons and their support cells, Schwann cells.  In addition, neurotrophic factors delivered through nanofiber in situ further enhance regenerative outcomes.  However, trophic factor delivery in this design is difficult to modulate and the nanofiber properties are suboptimal.  Objective/Hypothesis:  This proposal builds on the above findings and aims to further develop new nanofiber nerve guides with improved nanofiber guidance cue and modulated trophic factor delivery capabilities that promise faster nerve regeneration and better functional recovery.   Specific Aims:  (1) To engineer nerve guides with aligned biodegradable nanofibers that provide contact guidance cue and modulated neurotrophic factor delivery to regenerating axons and Schwann cells; (2) To assess nerve regeneration rate and functional recovery in a rat model of nerve repair, and to optimize nerve guide configurations; (3) To demonstrate efficacy in a large animal model using optimized nerve guide from Aim 2, as a prerequisite for clinical translation.  Study Design:  Aim 1 of the study focuses on engineering nerve guides with different nanofiber cues and neurotrophic factor delivery capacity, which can be pursued in parallel.  Effects of nanofiber diameter and adhesion molecules (tethered on fiber surface) on axonal outgrowth and Schwann cell migration will be assessed in cell culture.  Release kinetics and loading capacity of neurotrophic factors (GDNF, BDNF, NGF, and PTN) will be assessed in vitro.  In Aim 2, we will evaluate regeneration outcomes (rate of regeneration and functional recovery) of the engineered nerve guides in a rat sciatic nerve repair model.  This model will allow screening of different nerve guide configurations, investigating the role of each type of cue in promoting nerve regeneration, and understanding the mechanism of regeneration.  The optimized nerve guide configuration will then be tested in a larger animal (dog) model for efficacy of regeneration and functional recovery in Aim 3.  Since the efficacy of nerve regeneration cannot be simply extrapolated from a small animal study, this Aim is crucial in translating this new nanofiber nerve guide technology to clinical applications.  Impact:  Once successfully developed, the artificial biodegradable nerve guide can be used in trauma and war wounds that require surgical repair of nerve injuries.  It will obviate the need to harvest autologous nerve graft, thereby preventing harvest site complications.  This is especially an important issue for war wounds as often the injury affects multiple limbs and limits the availability of donor autologous nerves to be used in repair of vital nerves.  Availability of an off-the-shelf nerve conduit would greatly enhance the success of nerve repairs.  Furthermore, it will also reduce surgical time and morbidity associated with surgery and longer anesthesia.    Project/Task Area:  This proposal addresses the  Regenerative Medicine  component of the FY10 DMRDP Project/Task because it aims to offer a better and more efficient regenerative pathway for peripheral nerve injuries.\n",

      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our previous research in rats has shown that exposure to bladder inflammation during the neonatal period of development markedly enhances the degree of bladder hyperalgesia that occurs in response to a second exposure to bladder inflammation as an adult. Neonatal bladder inflammation also significantly increases micturition frequency and significantly decreases the threshold for micturition reflexes in adulthood. These outcomes are consistent with the primary symptoms of painful bladder syndrome (PBS) / interstitial cystitis (IC) and suggest that neonatal bladder inflammation may be a contributing factor to bladder disorders. The general hypothesis of the present proposal is that neonatal bladder inflammation predisposes an organism to adult bladder pain by impairing the development and/or function of an opioid inhibitory system that normally serves to suppress bladder pain. The specific hypotheses that refine and develop this general hypothesis are tested in the following specific aims:     Specific Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that the estrous cycle influences the magnitude of the endogenous opioid inhibitory response evoked by bladder inflammation in the adult rat. Specific Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that neonatal bladder inflammation predisposes an organism to adult bladder pain by impairing a descending inhibitory system originating from neurons located in the rostroventral medulla (RVM). Specific Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that neonatal bladder inflammation predisposes an organism to adult bladder pain by altering <-, :- and/or 4-opioid receptor expression in the spinal cord. Specific Aim 4 will test the hypothesis that neonatal bladder inflammation predisposes an organism to adult bladder pain by altering spinal cord opioid peptide content. Specific Aim 5 will test the hypothesis that neonatal bladder inflammation predisposes an organism to adult bladder pain by reducing opioid inhibition of spinal dorsal horn neurons     We believe these systematic studies, based on an innovative hypothesis, will lay the groundwork for potential novel therapeutic modalities for the treatment of urinary bladder pain by identifying opposing substrates underlying the development of bladder pain. Translation to the treatment of painful bladder syndromes would be highly probable because we will be able to identify key loci for targeted interventions.     PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We believe these systematic studies, based on an innovative hypothesis, will lay the groundwork for potential novel therapeutic modalities for the treatment of urinary bladder pain associated with painful bladder syndrome (PBS) / interstitial cystitis (IC) by identifying opposing substrates underlying the development of bladder pain. Translation to the treatment of PBS/IC would be highly probable because we will be able to identify key developmental factors that give rise to the disorders, underlying mechanisms responsible for the disorders, and loci for targeted interventions.\n",

      "--------------------\n",
      "Ã¯Â»Â¿   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The impact of mitochondrial biology on human cancers is broad because these organelles are critical regulators of metabolism, proliferation, and apoptosis. Indeed, mitochondrial aberrations are common in multiple cancer types --- not only do mitochondrial dysfunctions correlate with disease pathogenesis, but aberrant mitochondria also negatively impact upon chemotherapeutic success. Within a cell, mitochondrial homeostasis is maintained by a process referred to as  mitochondrial dynamics , which is essential for mitochondrial genome integrity, efficient ATP generation, managing ROS, and the rapid distribution of mitochondrial metabolites. Mitochondrial dynamics result from the cumulative nature of two opposing forces: mitochondrial division and mitochondrial fusion. Recent published work from my group demonstrated: (1) mitochondrial division is chronically enhanced in RAS-transformed murine cells and human cancer lines harboring mutations within the MAPK pathway, (2) the mitochondrial division machinery is essential for cellular transformation, (3) targeted therapies that inhibit oncogenic MAPK signaling turn off the mitochondrial division machinery, and (4) chronic mitochondrial division is sufficient to initiate mitochondrial dysfunction and cancer cell metabolism. For decades, the presence of mtDNA mutations and mitochondrial dysfunction in cancer has been described, but the molecular mechanisms that drive these changes and their impact on cancer biology remain speculative. While others and we identified that mitochondrial division is requisite to cancer-associated mitochondrial dysfunction and is targeted by oncogenic MAPK pathway inhibitors, the molecular mechanisms linking mitochondrial division, mitochondrial dysfunction, and cancer cell survival are poorly understood. We hypothesize that oncogenic MAPK signaling induces chronic mitochondrial fragmentation, which supports mutation of the mitochondrial genome and subsequent functional heterogeneity within the mitochondrial network. This project emerged following years of effort to identify how mitochondrial division contributes to cancer biology, andwe propose three complementary specific aims. Aim 1: Establish that chronic mitochondrial division is responsible for cancer-associated mtDNA mutations and subsequent mitochondrial dysfunction in melanocytes. Aim 2: Demonstrate that chronic mitochondrial division induced mtDNA mutations link mitochondrial heterogeneity, tumorigenic potential, and metabolic plasticity. Aim 3: Reveal the broad requirement for chronic mitochondrial division in oncogenic transformation of cells and tissues. These aims will be achieved by using next-generation mtDNA sequencing, state-of-the-art mitochondrial function assays, and metabolomics approaches. Together, the results of this application will reveal that: (1) chronic mitochondrial division is permissive for mtDNA mutations, mitochondrial dysfunction, and tumorigenesis; and (2) proof-of- concept evidence that pharmacologically targeting chronic mitochondrial division may provide therapeutic potential to prevent and treat cancer.\n",

      "intestinal gut ibd microbiota epithelial microbiome colitis mucosal bowel colon\n",
      "--------------------\n",
      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The human gut harbors an enormously diverse community of microorganisms collectively referred to as the  microbiome . This microbiome has co-evolved with humans over half a billion years to assist in critical host metabolic and immune function. The impact of changes in the microbiome on disease states as diverse as diabetes, obesity, inflammatory bowel disease, epilepsy, and multiple sclerosis is only now being recognized. It is clear that human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection has profound effects on the intestinal mucosal environment with one of the hallmarks of HIV infection being a rapid and profound depletion of CD4+ T cells within gut associated lymphoid tissue (GALT). Despite this, there is a paucity of information regarding the changes that occur in the intestinal microbiota in HIV infection and the potential effects of these changes on host immunity and HIV disease progression. It is believed that HIV infection results in intestinal inflammation and increased intestinal mucosal permeability with subsequent translocation of luminal microbial products into the systemic circulation. This microbial translocation drives chronic immune activation, which results in T cell exhaustion and HIV disease progression. The mechanism by which HIV induces intestinal epithelial dysfunction and microbial translocation remains incompletely understood. Even less is known about how gut microbial populations may influence, or be influenced by, this process. Still, it has been shown that enteric microbiota in humans and nonhuman primates can be significantly altered early in infection by lentiviral-mediated disease. Abnormal microbiota are strongly associated with intestinal inflammation in inflammatory bowel disorders with data suggesting a causal role in gut inflammation. This suggests that the microbiome may play a direct role in mediating intestinal dysfunction. It is therefore critical to develop a more detailed understanding of the impact of alterations in the intestinal microbiome on HIV-associated intestinal dysfunction and disease progression. This proposal seeks to define the role of the enteric microbiome and virome in HIV infection by using high-throughput next generation sequencing (NGS) to conduct a comprehensive survey of dynamic changes in gut microbial populations using stool, tissue and plasma from human subjects. We will define novel components of the human intestinal microbiome in the uninfected state as well as alterations that occur with advanced HIV/AIDS and upon initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART). We will link the microbiome in stool with microbial species associated with the intestinal tissue and explore the mechanism by which tissue associated microbes contribute to HIV disease progression. Finally, we will compliment these studies with an analysis of the mechanism by which changes in the enteric microbiome contribute to HIV disease progression. These studies will result in a more detailed fundamental understanding of the relationship between the intestinal ecology and its role in HIV disease progression and also identify potential new interventions targeting the intestinal microbiome to treat the long term inflammatory consequences of HIV infection.\n",

      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Parkinson disease (PD) is characterized by cardinal symptoms of bradykinesia, rigidity, and resting tremor considered reflective of dopaminergic (DA) neuronal loss in the nigrostriatal tract. These motor symptoms can be accompanied by impairments in cognition, although there is heterogeneity in the cognitive deficits associated with PD. While DA depletion has been correlated with the severity of motor impairment in PD, prior studies investigating the effects of DA medication on cognitive tasks have been inconsistent and the role of the basal ganglia in cognition is controversial. Few studies have evaluated patients in both on and off medication states, and there are inconsistent results in the studies which have been conducted. Thus, the neuroanatomical and neurochemical correlates of cognitive dysfunction in PD are uncertain. The specific hypothesis behind the research is that only some PD disordered behaviors are mediated by DA, and that DA treatment has differential effects depending on task demands. We base that hypothesis on the following observations: First, not all behavioral deficits of PD can be accounted for on the basis of pure motor impairment, and/ or DA depletion. Second, dopaminergic treatment differentially impacts performance depending on task demands, and is related to the extent of dopamine-depletion in the affected circuits. Based on these observations, the experimental focus of this proposal is on determining in PD under which conditions (i.e., task demands) DA regulatory mechanisms influence performance. The specific aims are designed to provide an assessment of the dopaminergic modulation of the cognitive aspects of motor control in PD. The specific aims are the following: (1) To determine the role of DA in regulating incremental skill acquisition, feedback control processes, and movement amplitude in PD. (2) To characterize implicit memory deficits in PD and investigate DA modulation. (3) To determine the role of DA in regulating spatiotemporal features of limb sequences in PD. We propose that DA regulates planning aspects of incremental skill acquisition when reliant on internal cues, but not PD deficits in movement amplitude or limb sequence acquisition. Conversely, DA will have a detrimental effect on spatial features of limb sequences. We predict that implicit memory deficits in PD can be divided into subtypes only some of which are mediated by DA. We base these hypotheses on dissociations in our pilot data that exist across various task demands. The proposed aims will help elucidate DA regulatory mechanisms controlling motor and cognitive symptoms of PD, as a necessary prerequisite to development of therapeutic protocols capable of treating all aspects of PD disordered behavior. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Parkinson disease (PD) is a progressive disease that usually affects the motor system, but it is also associated with a non-motor symptom complex that contributes significantly to morbidity and institutionalization, more than quadrupling the cost of care. Recent evidence suggests that non-motor symptoms such as cognitive dysfunction may be markers of a preclinical stage of PD, although cognitive symptoms in PD are not well recognized in clinical practice and it is uncertain how current treatments with dopamine agonists affect cognition. The proposed study will characterize cognitive symptoms in PD and evaluate treatment with dopaminergic medication as a necessary prerequisite to the development of therapeutic protocols capable of treating the full constellation of PD symptoms.\n",

      "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Human infants are confronted with a complex world that is filled with ambiguity. Not only are many different features and dimensions of information present in the environment, but these cues are often unrelated to any reinforcement or feedback. There are two solutions to learning in a complex and ambiguous environment: (a) innate constraints on the cues selected for processing (bottom-up), or (b) rapid learning-to-learn mechanisms that assess cues (top-down). Learned top-down mechanisms of information selection may be tuned more to specific task demands, and thus more useful for learning. Given how much infants have to learn over the first two years of life, it is not efficient to use mainly slow but precise (top-down) search methods. My hypothesis is that the developmental progression of learning how to learn requires using bottom-up information in a systematic way, while creating top-down buffers against bottom- up distraction. The experiments in the research plan will test this hypothesis, with each experiment evaluating an additional level of learning. Sophisticated behavioral techniques (i.e., both table- and head-mounted eye- tracking) and complementary state-of-the-art neuroimaging methods (i.e., functional near-infrared spectroscopy [fNIRS], measuring spatially-localized neural activation via non-invasive light probes on the scalp), as well as data mining tools applied to infant eye movement data, will examine how infants learn to learn from both computer displays and in naturalistic settings. There are four specific aims in this research program: 1) to establish a new, robust measure of learning with both behavioral and neural measures, 2) to investigate how attentional deployment can optimally improve learning, 3) to apply the learning paradigm to the natural environment, and 4) to conduct microanalyses on and to develop computational models of infant eye movements. The training component focuses on learning to use two state-of-the-art methods in infancy research (a head-mounted eye-tracker and fNIRS), and learning to use innovative data mining tools to analyze patterns of infant eye movements to link looking behavior to cognitive abilities. This training program is essential for the applicant's career goal of identifying the optimal strategies for learning to learn that will lead to training regimens for populations with learning difficulties. The findings will benefit researchers within the larger community of developmental science, as well as artificial intelligence, perceptual learning, education, animal learning, machine learning, and evolutionary psychology. This work will contribute to a foundational understanding of the dynamics of selective attention and learning in typical development, which in turn would inform populations with learning difficulties.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This multi-disciplinary research program will indicate signatures of optimal attentional deployment for efficient learning among distractions via converging evidence from behavioral and neuroimaging methods and data mining tools. This work will contribute to a foundational understanding of the dynamics of selective attention and learning in typical development, which in turn would inform populations with learning difficulties.\n",

The subproject andinvestigator (PI) may have received primary funding from another NIH source,and thus could be represented in other CRISP entries. The institution listed isfor the Center, which is not necessarily the institution for the investigator.Background & Aims: The Gastrointestinal tract (GIT) is a major target of HIV/SIV infection. Although our understanding of HIV/SIV enteropathy has greatly improved, the recent discovery of miRNAs has added yet another novel and complex regulator of gene expression with potential roles in the molecular pathogenesis of this disorder. microRNAs (miRNAs) are genomically transcribed, ~21-23 nucleotide noncoding RNAs that are highly conserved and suppress gene expression by targeting mRNAs for translational repression or degradation. We investigated the contribution of 11 miRNAs to GIT disease and inflammation using the SIV-infected rhesus macaque model. Methods: Colon tissue was collected at necropsy from 10 SIV-infected (G1) with chronic diarrhea and 5 uninfected control macaques (G2). The contributions of miR-21, miR-125b, miR-132, miR-142-3p, miR-142-5p, miR-146a, miR-155, miR-203, miR-212, miR-223 and miR-338, previously known to be associated with inflammation were investigated using QRT-PCR, In situ hybridization/Immunofluorescence, histopathology and mass spectrometry. Results: All G1 macaques had chronic diarrhea, wasting and colitis. Significant to moderate increase in the expression of miR-142-3p, miR-142-5p (5-6-fold), miR-212 (3-fold), miR-21 (2-fold) was observed in the colon of G1 macaques compared to G2 animals. Interestingly, miR-125b and miR-203 were downregulated (2-3 fold) in G1 animals. No change in miR-132, miR-146a, miR-155 , miR-223 and miR-338 expression was observed between the groups. In situ hybridization using Locked-nucleic acid modified miR-212 probes revealed cytoplasmic and nuclear localization in the colonic epithelium and lamina propria cells (macrophages). Using mass spectrometry, we validated several predicted mRNA targets of miR-142-3p and miR-212 following over expression of both miRNAs in in vitro cultured primary intestinal macrophages. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that deregulation in cell/tissue-specific expression of miRNAs occurring in response to HIV/SIV infection may disrupt the functional relationship between the intestinal epithelium and the mucosal immune system causing alterations in intestinal structure and function.\n",

      "Identification of functional variants is an end-game of analysis of genetically influenced diseases and a starting point to understand roles of genes in behaviors. Public databases are populated with >22 million sequence variants, mostly single nucleotide polymorphisms. However, most rare and uncommon variants are unknown, and functionality of most is unknown. Through a combination of in-vivo and in vitro functional genomics studies we have discovered several functional loci and demonstrated their roles in complex behaviors relevant to alcoholism and addictions. We discovered or helped define in vitro and in vivo effects of a series of functional polymorphisms altering behavior. In alcoholism, an OPRM1 Asn40Asp missense variant (Bergen et al, 1997) was shown by others to be functional and linked to naltrexone treatment response (Anton et al, 2008). A common, functional LA->LG SNP in the serotonin transporter HTTLPR locus (Hu et al) enhanced linkage to behaviors and intermediate phenotypes. These include SSRI response of depressed patients (Hu et al, 2007), neuroimaging responses to emotion, and gene x stress interactions leading to suicidality (Roy et al, 2007).  Common HTR2C Ser23Cys (Lappalainen et al) and HTR2A Asn452His alleles (Ozaki et al) were detected and shown to be functional, and linked by others to behavior, including clozapine response. In first-episode schizophrenics, we found that a functional DRD2 promoter polymorphism influences antipsychotic response (Lencz et al, 2006). We traced linkages of functional loci and haplotypes of NPY (Zhu et al, 2008), GCH1 (Tegeder et al, 2006) and DISC1 (a series of papers beginning with Hodgkinson et al, 2004) to various behaviors including emotionality, schizophrenia and clinical pain outcome. By deep sequencing we found an HTR2B Stop codon that is relatively common in Finns, absent in other populations, and associated with but not determinant for impulsive behavior. This stop codon also cosegregated with impulsive behavior in families, and the mouse gene knockout was more impulsive and higher in novelty seeking. As an example of the type of molecular studies performed with polymorphisms listed in this paragraph, the HTR2B stop codon led to variable nonsense mediated decay of the HTR2B RNA and blocked expression of the receptor (Bevilacqua et al, Nature, 2010).  A low expression Neuropeptide Y (NPY) haplotype increased anxiety and emotionality but had stronger effects on molecules (NPY RNA and protein) and intermediate phenotypes (brain imaging measures of responses to emotional stimuli and pain/stress) than complex behavior. (Zhou et al, Nature, 2008). Intermediate phenotypes augment genetic analyses of behavior. The imaging genetics paradigm we helped initiate (Heinz et al, 2000; Hariri et al, 2002; Egan et al, 2001; 2003; Zubieta et al, 2003)  has continued to yield groundbreaking findings. With collaborators at NIDA, we helped discover that the mechanism of action of CHRNA5 Asn398, the major functional locus from nicotine GWAS,  involves weakening of a Dorsal Anterior Cingulate/Ventral Striatal circuit, the weakness of which predicts nicotine craving in smokers with and without other psychiatric diagnoses (Hong et al, 2010). Clinical subphenotyping enabled linkage of HTR1B to antisocial alcoholism (Lappalainen et al), serotonin transporter (SLCA4) to anxiety (Mazzanti et al; Hariri et al), BDNF Val66Met to episodic memory (Egan et al), COMT Val158Met to anxiety (Enoch et al), executive cognition (Egan et al; Lipsky et al; Malhotra et al), and pain threshold (Zubieta et al; Diatchenko et al), and GTP cyclohydrolase to chronic pain and experimental pain response (Tegeder et al). In these studies brain imaging and cognitive measures play prominent roles. Frontal cognitive deficit is a risk factor in schizophrenia, alcoholism and other diseases. Dopamine generally enhances prefrontal cortical efficiency. Met158, a common COMT variant, leads to four-fold reduction in COMT activity. It is thus a candidate allele for cognitive function via effect on frontal dopamine. We found an allele-dosage relationship of Met158 to frontal cognitive function and diminished frontal cortical efficiency (Egan et al). The relationship to cognition is observed in populations differing in baseline cognitive function: schizophrenia, moderate-severe head injury (Lipsky et al), & controls (Malhotra et al). We proposed that Val158 has a counter-advantage: stress resiliency. In two populations Met158 predicted anxiety in women and decreased frontal EEG coherence (Enoch et al), and Met158 was associated with lower resiliency to pain/stress (Zubieta et al; Diatchenko et al). Met158 predicted inability to activate endomorphin release after pain/stress (Zubieta et al). Overall, effect sizes of genes in intermediate phenotypes is larger (Goldman and Ducci, 2007) and as illustrated by effects of genes such as NPY (Zhou et al, 2008), COMT (Zubieta et al, 2003) and CHRNA5 (Hong et al, 2010) on intermediate phenotypes.Linkage, gwas and RNA-seq are representative of genomic, hypothesis-free approaches. Linkage disequilibrium of alcoholism to GABRA2 was found at the Chr 4 GABAA subunit cluster we implicated by family linkage (Long et al). We showed the association was anxiety- modulated (Enoch et al). Another GABAA gene cluster implicated in alcoholism and alcohol response is located on Chr 5. Within this cluster we reported linkage disequilibrium to alcoholism (Radel et al) and that GABRA6 has a missense variant associated with alcohol dependence and response to alcohol and diazepam (Iwata et al, Schuckit et al). A family linkage scan yielded genome-wide significant linkage of CRH-BP (a stress-related protein) to an alcoholism-associated EEG trait and this was followed by association of CRH-BP to EEG in two populations. (Enoch et al). Our gwas of EEG (Hodgkinson et al, PNAS, 2010) in a relatively small sample of Plains Indians detected three independent genome-wide significant loci, and we replicated two loci (including one locus that was just sub-threshold) in a second population (Hodgkinson et al, PNAS 2010). We recently used next-generation sequencing to analyze brain histone methylation and transcriptome changes resulting from early maternal deprivation in Rhesus macaques (Barr et al, in preparation) and effects of chronic cocaine and alcohol in human brain (Zhou et al, PNAS 2010). The latter study found distinct differences between the gene networks that are regulated by chronic drug exposure in people, as compared to those detected in acute and subacute exposures in animal models.Founder populations, extreme probands, and exposed populations enhance power to detect gene effects. Our Finnish dataset is derived from a founder population and ascertained from criminal alcoholic probands & thus enriched for Type II early onset alcoholism. SW and Plains Indian samples represent founder populations. An African American substance dependence sample with high adversity exposure revealed GxE of childhood adversity and HTTLPR in suicidality (Roy et al, 2007). Stress and poverty, but not African ancestry, predicted high risk of addictions (Ducci et al, 2009). An MAOA VNTR previously linked to dyscontrol via stress interaction was linked to outcomes of alcohol dependence and ASPD in American Indian women, of whom half had been sexually abused as children (Ducci et al, 2008). A strong interaction between the MAOA VNTR and testosterone was observed in the Finnish criminal sample (Sjoberg et al). As mentioned, deep sequencing in Finns detected a population-specific  HTR2B Stop codon significant for impulsive behavior (Bevilacqua et al, Nature, 2010).\n"
